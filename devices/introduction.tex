\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart2} of the \gls{MTConnect}  Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of a piece of equipment and to define the data that is provided by an \gls{Agent} from the equipment.  The \gls{Devices Information Model}  also defines the structure for the \gls{XML} document that is returned from an \gls{Agent} in response to a \gls{Probe Request}. 

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operations of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders.
