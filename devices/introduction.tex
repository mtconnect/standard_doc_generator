\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart2} of the \gls{mtconnect}  Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of a piece of equipment and to define the data that is provided by an \gls{agent} from the equipment.  The \glspl{device information model}  also defines the structure for the \gls{xml} document that is returned from an \gls{agent} in response to a \gls{probe request}. 

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operations of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders. 

\begin{note}
Note: See \citetitle{MTCPart3} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the \gls{xml} documents that are returned from an \gls{agent} in response to a \gls{sample request} or \gls{current request}.
