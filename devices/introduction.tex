\label{sec:Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart2} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of a piece of equipment and to define the data that is provided by an \gls{agent} from the equipment.  The \gls{Device Information Model}  also defines the structure for the \gls{response document} that is returned from an \gls{agent} in response to a \gls{probe request}. 

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operations of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders. 


\begin{itemize}
    \item Note: See \citetitle{MTCPart3} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the \gls{response document} that are returned from an \gls{agent} in response to a \gls{sample request} or \gls{current request}.

\end{itemize}
