Descriptions for elements of \block{DataItem}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \block{Source} : \block{Source} identifies the \block{Component}, \block{DataItem}, or \block{Composition} representing the area of the piece of equipment from which a measured value originates.
\item \block{Constraints} : \block{Constraints} \glspl{organize} a set of expected values that can be reported for this \block{DataItem}.
\item \block{Filters} : \block{Filters} \glspl{organize} the \block{Filter} elements associated with this \block{DataItem} element. 
\item \block{InitialValue} : \block{InitialValue} defines the starting value for a data item as well as the value to be set for the data item after a reset event.
\item \block{ResetTrigger} : \block{ResetTrigger} identifies the type of event that may cause a reset to occur.
\item \block{Definition} : The \block{Definition} defines the meaning of \block{Entry} and \block{Cell} elements associated with the \block{DataItem} when the \property{representation} is either \block{DATA} or \block{TABLE}.
