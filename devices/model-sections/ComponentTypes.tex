\subsection{Component Types} \label{sec:ComponentTypes}

\gls{component} \glspl{structural element} are XML containers used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

\gls{component} \glspl{structural element} are defined into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements are used to group the \glspl{structural element} representing the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment.  The \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements provided in an \gls{mtconnectdevices} document \should be restricted to those defined in \tbl{elements-toplevel-for-component}.  However, these \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements \may also be used as \gls{lower level} \gls{component} elements; as required.

\item \gls{lower level} \gls{component} elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent \gls{component} to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements.
\end{itemize}

This section of the \glspl{device information model} provides guidance for the most common relationships between \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements and \gls{lower level} child components.  However, all \gls{component} elements \may be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

As described in \sect{Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices}, \gls{component} is an abstract type \gls{structural element} within the \glspl{device information model} and will never appear directly in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} XML document.  As abstract type XML elements, \gls{component} will be replaced in the XML document by a specific \gls{component} type.


\subsubsection{Actuator}
  \label{sec:Actuator}


Redefined as a piece of equipment with the ability to be represented as a {term:Lower Level} component of a parent {model:Component} element or as a {model:Composition} element. See {model:ACTUATOR}

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Auxiliaries}
  \label{sec:Auxiliaries}


An XML container used to organize information for {term:Lower Level} elements representing functional sub-systems that provide supplementary or extended capabilities for a piece of equipment, but they are not required for the basic operation of the equipment.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Axes}
  \label{sec:Axes}


An XML container used to organize the {term:Structural Elements} of a piece of equipment that perform linear or rotational motion.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Controller}
  \label{sec:Controller}


An XML container used to organize information about an intelligent or computational function within a piece of equipment.


Subtype of Controller is: .
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Deposition}
  \label{sec:Deposition}


{model:Deposition} is an XML container that represents the information for a system that manages the addition of material or state change of material being performed in an additive manufacturing process.  For example, this could describe the portion of a piece of equipment that manages a material extrusion process or a vat polymerization process.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Door}
  \label{sec:Door}


{model:Door} is an XML container that represents the information for a mechanical mechanism or closure that can cover.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Interface}
  \label{sec:Interface}


Each {model:Interface} contains {term:Data Entities} available from the piece of equipment that may be needed to coordinate activities with associated pieces of equipment.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Interfaces}
  \label{sec:Interfaces}


An XML container that organizes information used to coordinate actions and activities between pieces of equipment that communicate information between each other.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Power}
  \label{sec:Power}


{model:Power} was *DEPRECATED* in MTConnect Version 1.1 and was replaced by the {term:Data Entity} called {model:AVAILABILITY}.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Resources}
  \label{sec:Resources}


An XML container used to organize information for {term:Lower Level} elements representing types of items, materials, and personnel that support the operation of a piece of equipment or work to be performed at a location. {model:Resources} also represents materials or other items consumed or transformed by a piece of equipment for production of parts or other types of goods.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Structure}
  \label{sec:Structure}


Organizes static structural components of the machine.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Systems}
  \label{sec:Systems}


An XML container used to organize information for {term:Lower Level} elements representing the major sub-systems that are permanently integrated into a piece of equipment.
