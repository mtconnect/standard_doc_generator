\subsection{Component Types} \label{sec:Component Types}


\block{Component} \glspl{Structural Element} are used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

\block{Component} \glspl{Structural Element} are defined into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements are used to group the \glspl{Structural Element} representing the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment.  The \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements provided in an \block{MTConnectDevices} document \textbf{SHOULD} be restricted to those defined in this section.  However, these \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements \textbf{MAY} also be used as \gls{Lower Level} \block{Component} elements; as required.

\item \gls{Lower Level} \block{Component} elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent \block{Component} to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements.
\end{itemize}

This section of the \gls{Devices Information Model} provides guidance for the most common relationships between \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements and \gls{Lower Level} child components.  However, all \block{Component} elements \textbf{MAY} be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

As described in \sect{Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices}, \block{Component} is an abstract type \gls{Structural Element} within the \gls{Devices Information Model} and will never appear directly in the \block{MTConnectDevices} document.  As abstract elements, \block{Component} will be replaced in the document by a specific \block{Component} type.
