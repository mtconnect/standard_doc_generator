\subsection{Component Types} \label{sec:Component Types}


\block{Component} \glspl{Structural Element} are used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

\block{Component} \glspl{Structural Element} are defined into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements are used to group the \glspl{Structural Element} representing the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment.  The \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements provided in an \block{MTConnectDevices} document \textbf{SHOULD} be restricted to those defined in this section.  However, these \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements \textbf{MAY} also be used as \gls{Lower Level} \block{Component} elements; as required.

\item \gls{Lower Level} \block{Component} elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent \block{Component} to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements.
\end{itemize}

This section of the \gls{Devices Information Model} provides guidance for the most common relationships between \gls{Top Level} \block{Component} elements and \gls{Lower Level} child components.  However, all \block{Component} elements \textbf{MAY} be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

As described in \sect{Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices}, \block{Component} is an abstract type \gls{Structural Element} within the \gls{Devices Information Model} and will never appear directly in the \block{MTConnectDevices} document.  As abstract elements, \block{Component} will be replaced in the document by a specific \block{Component} type.

\subsubsection{Axes}
\label{sec:Axes}



\block{Axes} organizes information representing linear or rotational motion for a piece of equipment. The \block{Linear} axis \block{Component} represents linear motion, and the\block{Rotary} axis \block{Component} represents rotational motion.In robotics, the term \textit{Axis} is synonymous with \textit{Joint}. A \textit{Joint} is the connection between two parts of the structure that move in relation to each other.

\gls{linear} and \gls{rotary} components \MUST have a \gls{name} attribute that \MUST follow the conventions described below. Use the \gls{nativename} attribute for the manufacturer's name of the axis if it differs from the assigned \gls{name}.

\gls{mtconnect} has two high-level classes for automation equipment as follows: (1) Equipment that controls cartesian coordinate axes and (2) Equipment that controls articulated axes. There are ambiguous cases where some machines exhibit both characteristics; when this occurs, the primary control system's configuration determines the classification.

Examples of cartesian coordinate equipment are CNC Machine Tools, Coordinate measurement machines, as specified in ISO 841, and 3D Printers. Examples of articulated automation equipment are Robotic systems as specified in ISO 8373.

The following sections define the designation of names for the axes and additional guidance when selecting the correct scheme to use for a given piece of equipment.

\subsubsection{Cartesian Coordinate Naming Conventions}
\label{sec:Cartesian Coordinate Naming Conventions}

A Three-Dimensional Cartesian Coordinate control system organizes its axes orthogonally relative to a machine coordinate system where the manufacturer of the equipment specifies the origin. 

Axes \gls{name} \SHOULD comply with ISO 841, if possible.

\newpage

\paragraph{Linear Motion}\mbox{}
\label{sec:Linear Motion}

A piece of equipment \MUST represent prismatic motion using a \gls{linear} axis \gls{component} and assign its \gls{name} using the designations \cfont{X}, \cfont{Y}, and \cfont{Z}. A \gls{linear} axis \gls{name} \MUST append a monotonically increasing suffix when there are more than one parallel axes; for example, \cfont{X2}, \cfont{X3}, and \cfont{X4}. 

\paragraph{Rotary Motion}\mbox{}
\label{sec:Rotary Motion}

\gls{mtconnect} \MUST assign the \gls{name} to \gls{rotary} axes exhibiting rotary motion using \cfont{A}, \cfont{B}, and \cfont{C}. A \gls{rotary} axis \gls{name} \MUST append a monotonically increasing suffix when more than one \gls{rotary} axis rotates around the same \gls{linear} axis; for example, \cfont{A2}, \cfont{A3}, and \cfont{A4}. 

\subsubsection{Articulated Machine Control Systems}
\label{sec:Articulated Machine Control Systems}

An articulated control system's axes represent the connecting linkages between two adjacent rigid members of an assembly. The \gls{linear} axis represents prismatic motion, and the \gls{rotary} axis represents the rotational motion of the two related members. The control organizes the axes in a kinematic chain from the mounting surface (base) to the end-effector or tooling.

\subsubsection{Articulated Machine Axis Names}
\label{sec:Articulated Machine Axis Names}

The axes of articulated machines represent forward kinematic relationships between mechanical linkages. Each axis is a connection between linkages, also referred to as joints, and \MUST be named using a \cfont{J} followed by a monotonically increasing number; for example, \cfont{J1}, \cfont{J2}, \cfont{J3}.  The numbering starts at the base axis connected or closest to the mounting surface, \cfont{J1}, incrementing to the mechanical interface, \cfont{Jn}, where \cfont{n} is the number of the last axis. The chain forms a parent-child relationship with the parent being the axis closest to the base.

A machine having an axis with more than one child \MUST number each branch using its numeric designation followed by a branch number and a monotonically increasing number. For example, if \cfont{J2} has two children, the first child branch MUST be named \cfont{J2.1.1} and the second child branch \cfont{J2.2.1}. A child of the first branch \MUST be named \cfont{J2.1.2}, incrementing to \cfont{J2.1.n}, where \cfont{J2.1.n} is the number of the last axis in that branch.
