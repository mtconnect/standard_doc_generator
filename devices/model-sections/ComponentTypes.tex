\subsection{ComponentTypes} \label{model:ComponentTypes}

Component Structural Elements are containers used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

Component Structural Elements are defined into two major categories:

	Top Level Component elements are used to group the Structural Elements repre720 senting the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment. The Top Level Component elements provided in an MTConnectDevices document SHOULD be restricted to those defined below. However, these Top Level Component elements MAY also be used as Lower Level Component elements; as required.

	Lower Level Component elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent Component to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the Top Level Component elements.

This section of the Devices Information Model provides guidance for the most common relationships between Top Level Component elements and Lower Level child components. However, all Component elements MAY be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

Since Component is an abstract type Structural Element within the Devices Information Model and will never appear directly in the MTConnectDevices document. As abstract type elements, Component will be replaced in the document by a specific Component type.
