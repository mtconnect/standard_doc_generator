\subsection{ComponentTypes} \label{sec:ComponentTypes}

\gls{component} \glspl{structural element} are XML containers used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

\gls{component} \glspl{structural element} are defined into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements are used to group the \glspl{structural element} representing the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment.  The \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements provided in an \gls{mtconnectdevices} document \should be restricted to those defined in \tbl{elements-toplevel-for-component}.  However, these \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements \may also be used as \gls{lower level} \gls{component} elements; as required.

\item \gls{lower level} \gls{component} elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent \gls{component} to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements.
\end{itemize}

This section of the \glspl{device information model} provides guidance for the most common relationships between \gls{top level} \gls{component} elements and \gls{lower level} child components.  However, all \gls{component} elements \may be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

As described in \sect{Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices}, \gls{component} is an abstract type \gls{structural element} within the \glspl{device information model} and will never appear directly in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} XML document.  As abstract type XML elements, \gls{component} will be replaced in the XML document by a specific \gls{component} type.
