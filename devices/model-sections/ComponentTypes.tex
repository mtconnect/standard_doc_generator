\subsection{Component Types} \label{sec:ComponentTypes}

{block:Component} {term:Structural Elements} are XML containers used to represent physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

{block:Component} {term:Structural Elements} are defined into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item {term:Top Level} {block:Component} elements are used to group the {term:Structural Elements} representing the most significant physical or logical functions of a piece of equipment.  The {term:Top Level} {block:Component} elements provided in an {block:MTConnectDevices} document **\should** be restricted to those defined in {ref:elements-toplevel-for-component}.  However, these {term:Top Level} {block:Component} elements **\may** also be used as {term:Lower Level} {block:Component} elements; as required.

\item {term:Lower Level} {block:Component} elements are used to describe the sub-parts of the parent {block:Component} to provide more clarity and granularity to the physical or logical structure of the {term:Top Level} {block:Component} elements.
\end{itemize}

This section of the {term:Devices Information Model} provides guidance for the most common relationships between {term:Top Level} {block:Component} elements and {term:Lower Level} child components.  However, all {block:Component} elements **\may** be used in any configuration, as required, to fully describe a piece of equipment.

As described in {ref:Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices}, {block:Component} is an abstract type {term:Structural Element} within the {term:Devices Information Model} and will never appear directly in the {block:MTConnectDevices} XML document.  As abstract type XML elements, {block:Component} will be replaced in the XML document by a specific {block:Component} type.


\subsubsection{Actuator}
  \label{sec:Actuator}


Redefined as a piece of equipment with the ability to be represented as a \gls{Lower Level} component of a parent \block{Component} element or as a \block{Composition} element. See \block{ACTUATOR}

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Auxiliaries}
  \label{sec:Auxiliaries}


An XML container used to organize information for \gls{Lower Level} elements representing functional sub-systems that provide supplementary or extended capabilities for a piece of equipment, but they are not required for the basic operation of the equipment.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Axes}
  \label{sec:Axes}


An XML container used to organize the \gls{Structural Elements} of a piece of equipment that perform linear or rotational motion.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Controller}
  \label{sec:Controller}


An XML container used to organize information about an intelligent or computational function within a piece of equipment.


Subtype of Controller is: .
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Deposition}
  \label{sec:Deposition}


\block{Deposition} is an XML container that represents the information for a system that manages the addition of material or state change of material being performed in an additive manufacturing process.  For example, this could describe the portion of a piece of equipment that manages a material extrusion process or a vat polymerization process.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Door}
  \label{sec:Door}


\block{Door} is an XML container that represents the information for a mechanical mechanism or closure that can cover.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Interface}
  \label{sec:Interface}


Each \block{Interface} contains \gls{Data Entities} available from the piece of equipment that may be needed to coordinate activities with associated pieces of equipment.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Interfaces}
  \label{sec:Interfaces}


An XML container that organizes information used to coordinate actions and activities between pieces of equipment that communicate information between each other.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Power}
  \label{sec:Power}


\block{Power} was **DEPRECATED** in MTConnect Version 1.1 and was replaced by the \gls{Data Entity} called \block{AVAILABILITY}.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Resources}
  \label{sec:Resources}


An XML container used to organize information for \gls{Lower Level} elements representing types of items, materials, and personnel that support the operation of a piece of equipment or work to be performed at a location. \block{Resources} also represents materials or other items consumed or transformed by a piece of equipment for production of parts or other types of goods.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Structure}
  \label{sec:Structure}


Organizes static structural components of the machine.

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Systems}
  \label{sec:Systems}


An XML container used to organize information for \gls{Lower Level} elements representing the major sub-systems that are permanently integrated into a piece of equipment.
