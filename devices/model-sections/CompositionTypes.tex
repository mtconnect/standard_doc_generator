\subsection{Composition Types} \label{sec:Composition Types}


This section defines \block{Composition} type elements that are currently available to describe sub-parts of a \block{Component} element.


\subsubsection{Actuator}




A mechanism for moving or controlling a mechanical part of a piece of equipment.   
 It takes energy usually provided by air, electric current, or liquid and converts the energy into some kind of motion. 


\subsubsection{Amplifier}
\label{sec:Amplifier}



An electronic component or circuit for amplifying power, electric current, or voltage.


\subsubsection{Ballscrew}
\label{sec:Ballscrew}



A mechanical structure for transforming rotary motion into linear motion.


\subsubsection{Belt}
\label{sec:Belt}



An endless flexible band used to transmit motion for a piece of equipment or to convey materials and objects.


\subsubsection{Brake}
\label{sec:Brake}



A mechanism for slowing or stopping a moving object by the absorption or transfer of the energy of momentum, usually by means of friction, electrical force, or magnetic force.


\subsubsection{Chain}
\label{sec:Chain}



An interconnected series of objects that band together and are used to transmit motion for a piece of equipment or to convey materials and objects.


\subsubsection{Chopper}
\label{sec:Chopper}



A mechanism used to break material into smaller pieces.


\subsubsection{Chuck}




A mechanism that holds a part, stock material, or any other item in place.


\subsubsection{Chute}
\label{sec:Chute}



An inclined channel for conveying material.


\subsubsection{CircuitBreaker}
\label{sec:CircuitBreaker}



A mechanism for interrupting an electric circuit.


\subsubsection{Clamp}
\label{sec:Clamp}



A mechanism used to strengthen, support, or fasten objects in place.


\subsubsection{Compressor}
\label{sec:Compressor}



A pump or other mechanism for reducing volume and increasing pressure of gases in order to condense the gases to drive pneumatically powered pieces of equipment.


\subsubsection{Door}




A mechanical mechanism or closure that can cover a physical access portal into a piece of equipment allowing or restricting access to other parts of the equipment.


\subsubsection{Drain}
\label{sec:Drain}



A mechanism that allows material to flow for the purpose of drainage from, for example, a vessel or tank.


\subsubsection{Encoder}
\label{sec:Encoder}



A mechanism to measure position.


\subsubsection{ExposureUnit}
\label{sec:ExposureUnit}



A mechanism for emitting a type of radiation


\subsubsection{ExtrusionUnit}
\label{sec:ExtrusionUnit}



A mechanism for dispensing liquid or powered materials


\subsubsection{Fan}
\label{sec:Fan}



Any mechanism for producing a current of air.


\subsubsection{Filter}
\label{sec:Filter}



Any substance or structure through which liquids or gases are passed to remove suspended impurities or to recover solids.


\subsubsection{Galvanomotor}
\label{sec:Galvanomotor}



An electromechanical actuator that produces deflection of a beam of light or energy in response to electric current through its coil in a magnetic field.


\subsubsection{Gripper}
\label{sec:Gripper}



A mechanism that holds a part, stock material, or any other item in place.


\subsubsection{Hopper}
\label{sec:Hopper}



A chamber or bin in which materials are stored temporarily, typically being filled through the top and dispensed through the bottom.


\subsubsection{LinearPositionFeedback}
\label{sec:LinearPositionFeedback}



A mechanism that measures linear motion or position.

\textbf{DEPRECATION WARNING} : May be deprecated in the future. Recommend using \block{ENCODER}.


\subsubsection{Motor}
\label{sec:Motor}



A mechanism that converts electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic energy into mechanical energy.


\subsubsection{Oil}
\label{sec:Oil}



A viscous liquid.


\subsubsection{PowerSupply}
\label{sec:PowerSupply}



A unit that provides power to electric mechanisms.


\subsubsection{Pulley}
\label{sec:Pulley}



A mechanism or wheel that turns in a frame or block and serves to change the direction of or to transmit force.


\subsubsection{Pump}
\label{sec:Pump}



An apparatus raising, driving, exhausting, or compressing fluids or gases by means of a piston, plunger, or set of rotating vanes.


\subsubsection{Reel}
\label{sec:Reel}



A rotary storage unit for material


\subsubsection{SensingElement}
\label{sec:SensingElement}



A mechanism that provides a signal or measured value.


\subsubsection{Spreader}
\label{sec:Spreader}



A mechanism for flattening or spreading materials


\subsubsection{StorageBattery}
