\subsection{DataItem Types} \label{sec:DataItem Types}


In the MTConnect Standard, \block{DataItem} elements are defined and organized based upon the \property{category} and \property{type} attributes.  The \property{category} attribute provides a high level grouping for \block{DataItem} elements based on the kind of information that is reported by the data item.

These categories are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \block{SAMPLE}

A \block{SAMPLE} reports a continuously variable or analog data value. 

\item \block{EVENT}

An \block{EVENT} reports information representing a functional state, with two or more discrete values, associated with a component or it contains a message.  The data provided may be a numeric value or text.

\item \block{CONDITION}

A \block{CONDITION} reports information about the health of a piece of equipment and its ability to function.
\end{itemize}

The \property{type} attribute specifies the specific kind of data that is reported.   For some types of data items, a \property{subType} attribute may also be used to differentiate between multiple data items of the same \property{type} where the information reported by the data item has a different, but related, meaning.

Many types of data items provide two forms of data: a value (reported as either a \block{SAMPLE} or \block{EVENT}) and a health status (reported as a \block{CONDITION}).  These \block{DataItem} types \textbf{MAY} be defined in more than one \property{category} based on the data that they report.



\subsubsection{Condition}
\label{sec:Condition}



\block{CONDITION} category data items report data representing a \gls{Structural Element}â€™s status regarding its ability to operate or it provides an indication whether the data reported for the \gls{Structural Element} is within an expected range.

\block{CONDITION} is reported differently than \block{SAMPLE} or \block{EVENT}.  \block{CONDITION} \textbf{MUST} be reported as \block{Normal}, \block{Warning}, or \block{Fault}.

All \block{DataItem} types in the \block{SAMPLE} category \textbf{MAY} have associated \block{CONDITION} states.  \block{CONDITION} states indicate whether the value for the data is within an expected range and \textbf{MUST} be reported as \block{Normal}, or the value is unexpected or out of tolerance for the data and a \block{Warning} or \block{Fault} \textbf{MUST} be provided.


The value of \property{type}{DataItem} with \property{category}{DataItem} \texttt{Condition} \MUST be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}


\item \texttt{COMMUNICATIONS}  

An indication that the piece of equipment has experienced a communications failure.


\item \texttt{DATA\textunderscore RANGE}  

An indication that the value of the data associated with a measured value or a calculation is outside of an expected range.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Event}
\label{sec:Event}



\block{DataItem} types in the \block{EVENT} category represent a discrete piece of information from a piece of equipment.  \block{EVENT} does not have intermediate values that vary over time.

An \block{EVENT} is information that, when provided at any specific point in time, represents the current state of the piece of equipment.
