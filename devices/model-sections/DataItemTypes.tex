\subsection{DataItem Types} \label{sec:DataItemTypes}

In the MTConnect Standard, \gls{dataitem} elements are defined and organized based upon the \gls{category} and \gls{type} attributes.  The \gls{category} attribute provides a high level grouping for \gls{dataitem} elements based on the kind of information that is reported by the data item.

These categories are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{sample category}

A \gls{sample category} reports a continuously variable or analog data value. 

\item \gls{event category}

An \gls{event category} reports information representing a functional state, with two or more discrete values, associated with a component or it contains a message.  The data provided may be a numeric value or text.

\item \gls{condition category}

A \gls{condition category} reports information about the health of a piece of equipment and its ability to function.
\end{itemize}

The \gls{type} attribute specifies the specific kind of data that is reported.   For some types of data items, a \gls{subtype} attribute may also be used to differentiate between multiple data items of the same \gls{type} where the information reported by the data item has a different, but related, meaning.

Many types of data items provide two forms of data: a value (reported as either a \gls{sample category} or \gls{event category}) and a health status (reported as a \gls{condition category}).  These \gls{dataitem} types \may be defined in more than one \gls{category} based on the data that they report.



\subsubsection{Condition}
  \label{sec:Condition}


\gls{condition category} category data items report data representing a \gls{structural element}â€™s status regarding its ability to operate or it provides an indication whether the data reported for the \gls{structural element} is within an expected range.

\gls{condition category} is reported differently than \gls{sample category} or \gls{event category}.  \gls{condition category} \must be reported as \gls{normal}, \gls{warning}, or \gls{fault}.

All \gls{dataitem} types in the \gls{sample category} category \may have associated \gls{condition category} states.  \gls{condition category} states indicate whether the value for the data is within an expected range and \must be reported as \gls{normal}, or the value is unexpected or out of tolerance for the data and a \gls{warning} or \gls{fault} \must be provided.

\item \texttt{DATA_RANGE} : An indication that the value of the data associated with a measured value or a calculation is outside of an expected range.
