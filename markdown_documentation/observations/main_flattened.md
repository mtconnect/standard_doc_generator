# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{citetitle(MTCPart3)}} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology that describes the information returned by an {{term(MTConnect Agent)}} from a piece of equipment.  The {{term(Observation Information Model}} also defines, in {{sect(Observations Information Model)}}, the structure for the {{termplural(response document)}} that are returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(sample request)}} or {{term(current request)}}.  

{{citetitle(MTCPart3)}} is not a stand-alone document.   This document is used in conjunction with {{citetitle(MTCPart1)}}  which defines the fundamentals of the operation of the MTConnect Standard and {{citetitle(MTCPart2)}} that defines the semantic model representing the information that may be returned from a piece of equipment.

> Note: {{citetitle(MTCPart5)}} provides details on extensions to the {{term(Observation Information Model)}} required to describe the interactions between pieces of equipment.

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operation of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders.

# Observations Information Model

The {{term(Observation Information Model)}} provides a representation of the data reported by a piece of equipment used for a manufacturing process, or used for any other purpose.  Additional descriptive information associated with the reported data is defined by the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity, which is described in {{citetitle(MTCPart2)}}.

Information defined in the {{term(Observation Information Model)}} allows a software application to (1) determine the {{termplural(Observation)}} for {{termplural(DataItem)}} returned from a piece of equipment and (2) interpret the data associated with those {{termplural(Observation)}} with the same meaning, value, and context that it had at its original source.  To do this, the software application issues one of two HTTP requests to an {{term(agent)}} associated with a piece of equipment.  They are:

* `sample`:  Returns a designated number of time stamped {{termplural(Observation)}} from an {{term(agent)}} associated with a piece of equipment; subject to any HTTP filtering associated with the request.  See {{cite(Section 8.3.3)}} of {{citetitle(MTCPart1)}} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the `sample` HTTP request.

* `current`:  Returns a snapshot of either the most recent values or the values at a given sequence number for all {{termplural(Observation)}} associated with a piece of equipment from an {{term(agent)}}; subject to any HTTP filtering associated with the request.  See {{cite(Section 8.3.2)}} of {{citetitle(MTCPart1)}} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the `current` HTTP request.


An {{term(agent)}} responds to either the `sample` or `current` HTTP request with an {{term(MTConnectStreams Response Document)}}.  This document contains information describing {{termplural(Observation)}} reported by an {{term(agent)}} associated with a piece of equipment.   A client software application may correlate the information provided in the {{term(MTConnectStreams Response Document)}} with the physical and logical structure for that piece of equipment defined in the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity to form a clear and unambiguous understanding of the information provided.  (See details on the structure for a piece of equipment described in {{citetitle(MTCPart2)}}).

{{block(Streams)}} for an {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entity contains a {{block(DeviceStream)}} entity for each piece of equipment represented in the document.  Each {{block(DeviceStream)}} is comprised of two primary types of entities â€“ {{termplural(Component)}} and {{termplural(Observation)}}.  The contents of the {{block(DeviceStream)}} container are described in detail in this document, {{citetitle(MTCPart3)}} of the MTConnect Standard.

{{termplural(Component)}} are defined for both the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} and the {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entities.  These {{termplural(Component)}} are used to provide a logical organization of the information provided in each entity.  

* For an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity: {{termplural(Component)}} organize information that represents the physical and logical parts and sub-parts of a piece of equipment.  (See {{citetitle(MTCPart2)}}, Section 4 of the MTConnect Standard for more details on {{termplural(Component)}} used in the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity).  

* For an {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entity: {{termplural(Component)}} provide the structure to organize the data returned from a piece of equipment and establishes the proper context for that data.  The {{termplural(Component)}} specifically defined for {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} are {{block(DeviceStream)}} (see {{sect(DeviceStream)}}) and {{block(ComponentStream)}} (see {{sect(ComponentStream)}}).   

{{block(DeviceStream)}} and {{block(ComponentStream)}} entities have a direct correlation to each of the {{term(Component)}} defined in the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

Within each {{block(ComponentStream)}} entity in the {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entity, {{termplural(Observation)}} are modeled as {{block(Observation)}} entities. The three types of {{block(Observation)}} entity are {{block(Sample)}}, {{block(Event)}}, and {{block(Condition)}}.  (See {{sect(Observation Types)}} for more information on these entities.)


## MTConnectStreams

This section provides semantic information for the {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entity.

### Header


provides information from an {{term(agent)}} defining version information, storage capacity, and parameters associated with the data management within the {{term(agent)}}.


#### Value Properties of Header

{{tbl(value-properties-of-header)}} lists the Value Properties of {{block(Header)}}.

{: caption="Value Properties of Header"}

Descriptions for Value Properties of {{block(Header)}}:

* {{property(firstSequence)}} 

    {{term(sequence number)}} assigned to the oldest piece of {{term(streaming data)}} stored in the {{term(buffer)}} of the {{term(agent)}} immediately prior to the time that the {{term(agent)}} published the {{term(response document)}}.

It also includes the revision number of the {{term(schema)}} associated with that specific {{term(semantic data model)}}.
    
    As an example, the value reported for {{property(version)}} for a {{term(response document)}} that was structured based on {{term(schema)}} revision 10 associated with Version 1.4.0 of the MTConnect Standard would be:  1.4.0.10

* {{property(testIndicator)}}

* {{property(instanceId)}} 

    identifier for a specific instantiation of the {{term(buffer)}} associated with the {{term(agent)}} that published the {{term(response document)}}.  
         
    {{property(instanceId)}} **MUST** be changed to a different unique number each time the {{term(buffer)}} is cleared and a new set of data begins to be collected.

* {{property(creationTime)}} 

    timestamp that an {{term(agent)}} published the {{term(response document)}}. 

* {{property(bufferSize)}} 

    maximum number of {{termplural(DataItem)}} that **MAY** be retained in the {{term(agent)}} that published the {{term(response document)}} at any point in time.
    
    > Note 1 to entry:  {{property(bufferSize)}} represents the maximum number of sequence numbers that **MAY** be stored in the {{term(agent)}}. 
    
    > Note 2 to entry: The implementer is responsible for allocating the appropriate amount of storage capacity required to accommodate the {{property(bufferSize)}}.

## Representations

This section provides semantic information for the {{block(Representation)}} model.

![Representation](figures/Representation.png "Representation"){: width="0.8"}

> Note: See {{sect(Representation Schema Diagrams)}} for XML schema.

### Representation


specifies the format and structure of the {{property(result)}} for an {{block(Observation)}}. 

The {{block(Representation)}} type for an {{block(Observation)}} is defined by the associated {{block(DataItem)}}'s property {{property(representation)}} in the {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}}.

{{block(Value)}} is the default {{block(Representation)}} type for all {{block(Observation)}} types.

The name of the {{block(Observation)}} type is modified for all {{block(Representation)}} types other than {{block(Value)}} by appending the pascal case of the {{block(Representation)}} type. 

Example: The name for {{block(Sample)}} {{block(Observation)}} type `Temperature`with `Representation` type of `TimeSeries` becomes `TemperatureTimeSeries`.

### Value


default {{block(Representation)}} type for all {{block(Observation)}} types where {{property(result)}} of the {{block(Observation)}} types is an MTConnect data type. See {{sect(Data Types)}}.


### TimeSeries


{{block(Representation)}} for an {{block(Observation)}} composed of a series of sampled data.



{{block(TimeSeries)}} for an {{block(Observation)}} is defined by the associated {{block(DataItem)}}'s property {{property(representation)}} as `TIME_SERIES`.

{{block(DataItem)}} with `TIME_SERIES` {{property(representation)}} **MUST** have a {{property(category)}} of `SAMPLE`.

{{fig(TemperatureTimeSeries)}} shows the model for {{block(Temperature)}} ({{block(Sample)}} type) with a {{block(Representation)}} type of {{block(TimeSeries)}}. 

![TemperatureTimeSeries](figures/TemperatureTimeSeries.png "TemperatureTimeSeries"){: width="0.8"}

> Note: See {{fig(AbsTimeSeries Schema)}} for XML schema.

{{block(TimeSeries)}} **MUST** report multiple values at fixed intervals in a single {{block(Observation)}}. At minimum, one of {{block(DataItem)}} or {{block(Observation)}} **MUST** specify the {{property(sampleRate)}} in `Hertz`(values/second); fractional rates are permitted. When the {{block(Observation)}} and the {{block(DataItem)}} specify the {{property(sampleRate)}}, the {{block(Observation)}} {{property(sampleRate)}} supersedes the {{block(DataItem)}}.

The {{block(Observation)}} **MUST** set the {{property(timestamp)}} to the time the last value was observed. The {{property(duration)}} **MAY** indicate the time interval from the first to the last value in the series.

{{sect(Value Properties of TimeSeries)}} defines additional attributes for an {{block(Observation)}} with {{block(TimeSeries)}} {{block(Representation)}} type.

#### Value Properties of TimeSeries

{{tbl(value-properties-of-timeseries)}} lists the Value Properties of {{block(TimeSeries)}}.

{: caption="Value Properties of TimeSeries"}

Descriptions for Value Properties of {{block(TimeSeries)}}:

* {{property(sampleCount)}} 

    number of values given for the {{block(Observation)}}.

### Discrete


**DEPRECATED** {{block(Representation)}} for an {{block(Observation)}} where each discrete occurrence of the data may have the same value as the previous occurrence of the data.



{{block(Discrete)}} for an {{block(Observation)}} is defined by the associated {{block(DataItem)}}'s property {{property(representation)}} as `DISCRETE`.

{{block(DataItem)}} with `DISCRETE` {{property(representation)}} **MUST** have a {{property(category)}} of `EVENT`.

*MTConnect Version 1.5* replaced {{property(representation)}} `DISCRETE` with a {{property(discrete)}} property for {{block(DataItem)}}.

Each occurrence of the {{block(Observation)}} **MAY** have the same value as the previous occurrence, and **MUST NOT** suppress duplicates.

Examples of {{block(Discrete)}}: A `PartCount` reporting the completion of each part using a 1 to indicate completion of a single part, a `Message` that occurs each time a door opens. 

#### Value Properties of Discrete

{{tbl(value-properties-of-discrete)}} lists the Value Properties of {{block(Discrete)}}.

{{block(DataSet)}} reports multiple values as a set of {{term(key-value pair)}} where each {{term(key)}} **MUST** be unique. The representation of the {{term(key-value pair)}} is an {{block(Entry)}}. The value of each {{block(Entry)}} **MUST** have the same constraints and format as the {{block(Observation)}} defined for the `VALUE` {{property(representation)}} for the {{block(DataItem)}} {{property(type)}} (See {{sect(Value)}}). 

The meaning of each {{block(Entry)}} **MAY** be provided as the {{block(DataItem)}} {{block(EntryDefinition)}}.

{{fig(DataSet Example)}} shows {{block(Event)}} {{block(Observation)}} type {{block(Variable)}} with a {{block(Representation)}} type of `DataSet`.

#### Management of Data Set Observations

An {{term(agent)}} **MUST** maintain the current state of the {{block(DataSet)}} as described in {{citetitle(MTCPart1)}} *Section Part 1: Management of Streaming Data Storage*.

One or more {{termplural(key-value pair)}} **MAY** be added, removed, or changed in an {{block(Observation)}}. An {{term(agent)}} **MUST** publish the changes to one or more {{termplural(key-value pair)}} as a single {{block(Observation)}}. An {{term(agent)}} **MUST** indicate the removal of a {{term(key-value pair)}} from a {{block(DataSet)}} using the {{property(removed)}} attribute equal `true`.

When the {{block(DataItem)}} {{property(discrete,DataItem)}} attribute is `false` or is not present, an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(sample request)}} **MUST** only publish the changed {{term(key-value pair)}} since the previous state of the {{block(DataSet)}}.

When the {{block(DataItem)}} {{property(discrete,DataItem)}} attribute is `true`, an {{term(agent)}}, in response to a {{term(sample request)}}, **MUST** report all {{termplural(key-value pair)}} ignoring the state of the {{block(DataSet)}}.

When an {{term(agent)}} responds to a {{term(current request)}}, the {{term(response document)}} **MUST** include the full set of {{termplural(key-value pair)}}. If the {{term(current request)}} includes an `at` query parameter, the {{term(agent)}} **MUST** provide the set of {{termplural(key-value pair)}} at the  {{term(sequence number)}}.

When an {{block(Observation)}} {{term(reset)}} occurs, the {{block(DataSet)}} **MUST** remove all {{termplural(key-value pair)}} making the set empty. The {{block(Observation)}} **MAY** simultaneously populate the {{block(DataSet)}} with new {{termplural(key-value pair)}}. The previous entries **MUST NOT** be included and **MUST NOT** have {{property(removed)}} attribute equal `true`.

When the {{block(Observation)}}  is `UNAVAILABLE` the {{block(DataSet)}} **MUST** remove all {{termplural(key-value pair)}} making the set empty.

![WorkOffsetTable](figures/WorkOffsetTable.png "WorkOffsetTable"){: width="0.8"}

> Note: See {{fig(Table Schema)}} for XML schema.

{{block(Table)}} has the same behavior as the {{block(DataSet)}} for change tracking, clearing, and history. When an {{block(Entry)}} changes, all {{block(Cell)}} entities update at the same time; they are not tracked separately like {{block(Entry)}}.

The meaning of each {{block(Entry)}} and {{block(Cell)}} **MAY** be provided as the {{block(DataItem)}} {{block(EntryDefinition)}} and {{block(CellDefinition)}}.

The {{block(Entry)}} {{property(key)}} attribute **MUST** be the unique identity of the {{block(Entry)}} within an {{block(Observation)}}. The {{block(Cell)}} {{property(key)}} attribute **MUST** be the unique identity of the {{block(Cell)}} within an {{block(Entry)}}.

### Condition Example

{{block(Condition)}} types are represented differently in {{term(XML)}} when compared to {{block(Sample)}} and {{block(Event)}} types. The element name is the {{term(condition state)}} of the {{block(Condition)}} type in Pascal Case. The name of the {{block(Condition)}} type is represented by the attribute `type`.

If the {{term(condition state)}} is unavailable then the element name is represented by `Unavailable`.
