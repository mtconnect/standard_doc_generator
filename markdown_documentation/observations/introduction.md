# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{citetitle(MTCPart3)}} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology that describes the information returned by an {{term(MTConnect Agent)}} from a piece of equipment.  The {{term(Observation Information Model}} also defines, in {{sect(Observations Information Model)}}, the structure for the {{termplural(response document)}} that are returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(sample request)}} or {{term(current request)}}.  

{{citetitle(MTCPart3)}} is not a stand-alone document.   This document is used in conjunction with {{citetitle(MTCPart1)}}  which defines the fundamentals of the operation of the MTConnect Standard and {{citetitle(MTCPart2)}} that defines the semantic model representing the information that may be returned from a piece of equipment.

> Note: {{citetitle(MTCPart5)}} provides details on extensions to the {{term(Observation Information Model)}} required to describe the interactions between pieces of equipment.

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operation of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders.
