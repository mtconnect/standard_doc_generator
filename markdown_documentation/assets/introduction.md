# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{package(Asset Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard, details information that is common to all types of {{termplural(Asset)}}.  Part 4.0 of the MTConnect Standard provide semantic models for entities that are used in the manufacturing process, but are not considered to be a piece of equipment.  These entities are defined as {{termplural(Asset)}}.  These {{termplural(asset)}} may be removed from a piece of equipment without detriment to the function of the equipment and can be associated with other pieces of equipment during their lifecycle.  The data associated with these {{termplural(asset)}} may be retrieved from multiple sources that are each responsible for providing their knowledge of the {{term(asset)}}.
