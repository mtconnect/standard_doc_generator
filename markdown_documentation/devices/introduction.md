# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{package(Device Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of a piece of equipment and to define the data that is provided by an {{term(agent)}} from the equipment.  The {{term(Device Information Model)}}  also defines the structure for the {{term(response document)}} that is returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(probe request)}}. 

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operations of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders. 

> Note: See {{package(Observation Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the {{term(response document)}} that are returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(sample request)}} or {{term(current request)}}.
