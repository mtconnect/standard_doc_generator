## Composition Types

This section provides semantic information for the types of {{block(Composition)}} that are currently available to describe sub-parts of a {{block(Component)}}.

### Actuator


{{block(Composition)}} that moves or controls a mechanism or system.

It takes energy usually provided by air, electric current, or liquid and converts the energy into some kind of motion. 

### Amplifier


{{block(Composition)}} composed of an electronic component or circuit that amplifies power, electric current, or voltage.


### Ballscrew


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a mechanical structure that transforms rotary motion into linear motion.


### Belt


{{block(Composition)}} composed of an endless flexible band that transmits motion for a piece of equipment or conveys materials and objects.


### Brake


{{block(Composition)}} that slows or stops a moving object by the absorption or transfer of the energy of momentum, usually by means of friction, electrical force, or magnetic force.


### Chain


{{block(Composition)}} composed of interconnected series of objects that band together and are used to transmit motion for a piece of equipment or to convey materials and objects.


### Chopper


{{block(Composition)}} that breaks material into smaller pieces.


### Chuck


{{block(Composition)}} that holds a part, stock material, or any other item in place.


### Chute


{{block(Composition)}} composed of an inclined channel that conveys material.


### CircuitBreaker


{{block(Composition)}} that interrupts an electric circuit.


### Clamp


{{block(Composition)}} that strengthens, support, or fastens objects in place.


### Compressor


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a pump or other mechanism that reduces volume and increases pressure of gases in order to condense the gases to drive pneumatically powered pieces of equipment.


### CoolingTower


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a heat exchange system that uses a fluid to transfer heat to the atmosphere.


### Door


{{block(Composition)}} that can cover a physical access portal into a piece of equipment allowing or restricting access to other parts of the equipment.


### Drain


{{block(Composition)}} that allows material to flow for the purpose of drainage from, for example, a vessel or tank.


### Encoder


{{block(Composition)}} that measures position.


### ExpiredPot


{{block(Pot)}} for a tool that is no longer usable for removal from a {{block(ToolMagazine)}} or {{block(Turret)}}.


### ExposureUnit


{{block(Composition)}} that emits a type of radiation.


### ExtrusionUnit


{{block(Composition)}} that dispenses liquid or powered materials.


### Fan


{{block(Composition)}} that produces a current of air.


### Filter


{{block(Composition)}} through which liquids or gases are passed to remove suspended impurities or to recover solids.


### Galvanomotor


{{block(Composition)}} composed of an electromechanical actuator that produces deflection of a beam of light or energy in response to electric current through its coil in a magnetic field.


### Gripper


{{block(Composition)}} that holds a part, stock material, or any other item in place.


### Hopper


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a chamber or bin in which materials are stored temporarily, typically being filled through the top and dispensed through the bottom.


### LinearPositionFeedback


{{block(Composition)}} that measures linear motion or position.

**DEPRECATION WARNING** : May be deprecated in the future. Recommend using {{block(Encoder)}}.


### Motor


{{block(Composition)}} that converts electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic energy into mechanical energy.


### Oil


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a viscous liquid.


### Pot


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a tool storage location associated with a {{block(ToolMagazine)}} or {{block(AutomaticToolChanger)}}.


### PowerSupply


{{block(Composition)}} that provides power to electric mechanisms.


### Pulley


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a mechanism or wheel that turns in a frame or block and serves to change the direction of or to transmit force.


### Pump


{{block(Composition)}} that raises, drives, exhausts, or compresses fluids or gases by means of a piston, plunger, or set of rotating vanes.


### Reel


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a rotary storage unit for material.


### RemovalPot


{{block(Pot)}} for a tool that has to be removed from a {{block(ToolMagazine)}} or {{block(Turret)}} to a location outside of the piece of equipment.


### ReturnPot


{{block(Pot)}} for a tool that has been removed from {{term(spindle)}} or {{block(Turret)}} and awaiting for return to a {{block(ToolMagazine)}}.


### SensingElement


{{block(Composition)}} that provides a signal or measured value.


### Spreader


{{block(Composition)}} that flattens or spreading materials.


### StagingPot


{{block(Pot)}} for a tool that is awaiting transfer to a {{block(ToolMagazine)}} or {{block(Turret)}} from outside of the piece of equipment.


### Station


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a storage or mounting location for a tool associated with a {{block(Turret)}}, {{block(GangToolBar)}}, or {{block(ToolRack)}}.


### StorageBattery


{{block(Composition)}} composed of one or more cells in which chemical energy is converted into electricity and used as a source of power. 


### Switch


{{block(Composition)}} that turns on or off an electric current or makes or breaks a circuit.


### Table


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a surface for holding an object or material.


### Tank


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a receptacle or container that holds material.


### Tensioner


{{block(Composition)}} that provides or applies a stretch or strain to another mechanism.


### TransferArm


{{block(Composition)}} that physically moves a tool from one location to another.


### TransferPot


{{block(Pot)}} for a tool that is awaiting transfer from a {{block(ToolMagazine)}} to {{term(spindle)}} or {{block(Turret)}}.


### Transformer


{{block(Composition)}} that transforms electric energy from a source to a secondary circuit.


### Valve


{{block(Composition)}} that halts or controls the flow of a liquid, gas, or other material through a passage, pipe, inlet, or outlet.


### Vat


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a container that holds liquid or powdered materials.


### Water


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a fluid.


### Wire


{{block(Composition)}} composed of a string like piece or filament of relatively rigid or flexible material provided in a variety of diameters.


### Workpiece


{{block(Composition)}} composed of an object or material on which a form of work is performed.
