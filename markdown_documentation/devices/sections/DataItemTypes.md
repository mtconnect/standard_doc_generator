## DataItem Types

This section provides semantic information for the types of a {{block(DataItem)}}.

In the MTConnect Standard, {{block(DataItem)}} elements are defined and organized based upon the {{property(category)}} and {{property(type)}} attributes.  The {{property(category)}} attribute provides a high level grouping for {{block(DataItem)}} elements based on the kind of information that is reported by the data item.

These categories are:

* `SAMPLE`: A `SAMPLE` reports a continuously variable or analog data value. 

* `EVENT`: An `EVENT` reports information representing a functional state, with two or more discrete values, associated with a component or it contains a message.  The data provided may be a numeric value or text.

* `CONDITION`: A `CONDITION` reports information about the health of a piece of equipment and its ability to function.

The {{property(type)}} attribute specifies the specific kind of data that is reported.   For some types of data items, a {{property(subType)}} attribute may also be used to differentiate between multiple data items of the same {{property(type)}} where the information reported by the data item has a different, but related, meaning.

Many types of data items provide two forms of data: a value (reported as either a `SAMPLE` or `EVENT`) and a health status (reported as a `CONDITION`).  These {{block(DataItem)}} types **MAY** be defined in more than one {{property(category)}} based on the data that they report.


### Condition


abstract {{block(DataItem)}} that is about an entity's status regarding its ability to operate or it provides an indication whether the data reported for the entity is within an expected range.

{{block(Condition)}} is reported differently than {{block(Sample)}} or {{block(Event)}}.  {{block(Condition)}} **MUST** be reported as {{block(Normal)}}, {{block(Warning)}}, or {{block(Fault)}}.

All {{block(Sample)}}s **MAY** have associated {{block(Condition)}} states.  {{block(Condition)}} states indicate whether the value for the data is within an expected range and **MUST** be reported as {{block(Normal)}}, or the value is unexpected or out of tolerance for the data and a {{block(Warning)}} or {{block(Fault)}} **MUST** be provided.

The value of {{property(type)}} with {{property(category)}} `Condition` **MUST** be one of the following:


* `ACTUATOR` 

    indication of a fault associated with an actuator.

* `COMMUNICATIONS` 

    indication that the piece of equipment has experienced a communications failure.
