# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{package(Device Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of a piece of equipment and to define the data that is provided by an {{term(agent)}} from the equipment.  The {{term(Device Information Model)}}  also defines the structure for the {{term(response document)}} that is returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(probe request)}}. 

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operations of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders. 

> Note: See {{package(Observation Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the {{term(response document)}} that are returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(sample request)}} or {{term(current request)}}.

# Device Information Model

The {{term(Device Information Model)}} provides a representation of the physical and logical configuration for a piece of equipment used for a manufacturing process or for any other purpose.  It also provides the definition of data that may be reported by that equipment. 

Using information defined in the {{term(Device Information Model)}}, a software application can determine the configuration and reporting capabilities of a piece of equipment.  To do this, the software application issues a {{term(probe request)}} (defined in {{package(Fundamentals)}}) to an {{term(agent)}} associated with a piece of equipment. An {{term(agent)}} responds to the {{term(probe request)}} with an {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} that contains information describing both the physical and logical structure of the piece of equipment and a detailed description of each {{term(Observation)}} that can be reported by the {{term(agent)}} associated with the piece of equipment. This information allows the client software application to interpret the document and to extract the data with the same meaning, value, and context that it had at its original source.  

The {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} is comprised of two sections: {{block(Header)}} and {{block(Devices)}}.

The {{block(Header)}} section contains protocol related information as defined in {{package(Fundamentals)}}.

The {{block(Devices)}} section of the {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} contains a {{block(Device)}} entity for each piece of equipment described in the document.  Each {{block(Device)}} is comprised of two primary types of entities - {{termplural(Component)}} and {{termplural(DataItem)}}.  

{{termplural(Component)}} organize information that represents the physical and logical parts and sub-parts of a piece of equipment (See {{package(Components)}} for more details).  

{{termplural(DataItem)}} describe data that can be reported by a piece of equipment.  In the {{term(Device Information Model)}}, {{termplural(DataItem)}} are defined as {{block(DataItem)}} entities (See {{package(DataItem Types)}}).

The {{termplural(Component)}} and {{termplural(DataItem)}} in the {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} provide information representing the physical and logical structure for a piece of equipment and the types of data that the piece of equipment can report relative to that structure.   The {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} does not contain values for the data types reported by the piece of equipment.  The {{term(MTConnectStreams Response Document)}} defined in {{package(Observation Information Model)}} provides the data values that are reported by the piece of equipment.

> Note:  The MTConnect Standard also defines the information model for {{termplural(asset)}}.  An {{term(asset)}} is something that is used in the manufacturing process, but is not permanently associated with a single piece of equipment, can be removed from the piece of equipment without compromising its function, and can be associated with other pieces of equipment during its lifecycle.  See {{package(Asset Information Model)}} for more details on {{termplural(asset)}}.

# Components Model

{{block(MTConnectDevices)}} provides the physical and logical architecture of a piece of equipment. {{figure(Device Entity Hierarchy Example)}} provides an overview of the entities used in an example of an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

![Device Entity Hierarchy Example](figures/Device%20Entity%20Hierarchy%20Example.png "Device Entity Hierarchy Example"){: width="0.8"}

> Note 1 to entry: See {{lst(device-entity-hierarchy-example)}} for the {{term(XML)}} representation of the same example.

> Note 2 to entry: Example above only shows the {{block(Component)}} and {{block(Composition)}} level hierarchy. For a complete semantics on each kind see {{package(Components)}} and {{package(Compositions)}}.

A variety of entities are defined to describe a piece of equipment.  Some of these entities **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity, while others are optional and **MAY** be used, as required, to provide additional structure.

The first, or highest level, entity defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity is {{block(Devices)}}. {{block(Devices)}} is used to group one or more pieces of equipment into a single document.  {{block(Devices)}} **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

{{block(Device)}} is the next entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. A separate {{block(Device)}} entity is used to identify each piece of equipment for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. Each {{block(Device)}} provides information on the physical and logical structure of the piece of equipment and the data associated with that equipment. {{block(Device)}} can also represent any logical grouping of pieces of equipment that function as a unit or any other data source that provides data through an {{term(agent)}}.

One or more {{block(Device)}} entities **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

{{block(Components)}} is the next entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. {{block(Components)}} is used to group information describing lower level physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

{{block(Component)}} is the next level of entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. {{block(Component)}} is both an abstract type entity and an {{term(organizer)}} type entity. 

As an abstract entity, {{block(Component)}} will always be realized by a specific {{block(Component)}} type defined in {{package(Component Types)}}. Each {{block(Component)}} can also be used to organize information describing {{term(lower level)}} entities or {{termplural(DataItem)}} associated with the {{block(Component)}}.

If {{term(lower level)}} entities are described, these entities are by definition child {{block(Component)}} entities of a parent {{block(Component)}}. At this next level, the {{term(lower level)}} child {{block(Component)}} entities are grouped by {{block(Components)}}.

A {{block(Component)}} **MAY** be further decomposed into {{block(Composition)}} entities that are grouped by {{block(Compositions)}}. These describe the lowest level basic structural or functional building blocks contained within a {{block(Component)}}. Data provided for a {{block(Component)}} provides more specific meaning when it is associated with one of the {{block(Composition)}} entities of the {{block(Component)}}. The different {{block(Composition)}} types that **MAY** be defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity are defined in {{package(Compositions)}}.

This parent-child relationship can continue to any depth required to fully define a piece of equipment.

> Note: See {{figure(Device Entity Hierarchy Example)}} for an example.


## Components

This section provides semantic information for the {{block(Component)}} entity. {{figure(Components)}} shows the {{block(Component)}} model. 

![Components](figures/Components.png "Components"){: width="0.8"}

> Note: See {{sect(Components Schema Diagrams)}} for XML schema.


### Component

logical or physical entity that provides a capability.


{{block(Component)}} is an abstract entity and will be realized by specific {{block(Component)}} types for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. See {{package(Component Types)}} for more details on the {{block(Component)}} types.

{{block(Component)}} also provides structure for describing the {{term(lower level)}} entities associated with it.

At least one of {{block(Component)}}, {{block(DataItem)}}, or {{block(Reference)}} entities **MUST** be provided for a {{block(Component)}}.

![Component Example](figures/Component%20Example.png "Component Example"){: width="0.8"}

abstract {{block(Component)}} composed of a motion system that provides linear or rotational motion for a piece of equipment.


In robotics, the term *Axis* is synonymous with *Joint*. A *Joint* is the connection between two parts of the structure that move in relation to each other.

{{block(Linear)}} and {{block(Rotary)}} components **MUST** have a {{property(name)}} attribute that **MUST** follow the conventions described below. Use the {{property(nativeName)}} attribute for the manufacturer's name of the axis if it differs from the assigned {{property(name)}}.

MTConnect has two high-level classes for automation equipment as follows: (1) Equipment that controls cartesian coordinate axes and (2) Equipment that controls articulated axes. There are ambiguous cases where some machines exhibit both characteristics; when this occurs, the primary control system's configuration determines the classification.

Examples of cartesian coordinate equipment are CNC Machine Tools, Coordinate measurement machines, as specified in ISO 841, and 3D Printers. Examples of articulated automation equipment are Robotic systems as specified in ISO 8373.

The following sections define the designation of names for the axes and additional guidance when selecting the correct scheme to use for a given piece of equipment.

#### Cartesian Coordinate Naming Conventions

A Three-Dimensional Cartesian Coordinate control system organizes its axes orthogonally relative to a machine coordinate system where the manufacturer of the equipment specifies the origin. 

{{block(Axes)}} {{property(name)}} **SHOULD** comply with ISO 841, if possible.

##### Linear Motion

A piece of equipment **MUST** represent prismatic motion using a {{block(Linear)}} axis {{block(Component)}} and assign its {{property(name)}} using the designations `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. A {{block(Linear)}} axis {{property(name)}} **MUST** append a monotonically increasing suffix when there are more than one parallel axes; for example, `X2`, `X3`, and `X4`. 

##### Rotary Motion

MTConnect **MUST** assign the {{property(name)}} to {{block(Rotary)}} axes exhibiting rotary motion using `A`, `B`, and `C`. A {{block(Rotary)}} axis {{property(name)}} **MUST** append a monotonically increasing suffix when more than one {{block(Rotary)}} axis rotates around the same {{block(Linear)}} axis; for example, `A2`, `A3`, and `A4`. 

#### Articulated Machine Control Systems

An articulated control system's axes represent the connecting linkages between two adjacent rigid members of an assembly. The {{block(Linear)}} axis represents prismatic motion, and the {{block(Rotary)}} axis represents the rotational motion of the two related members. The control organizes the axes in a kinematic chain from the mounting surface (base) to the end-effector or tooling.

#### Articulated Machine Axis Names

The axes of articulated machines represent forward kinematic relationships between mechanical linkages. Each axis is a connection between linkages, also referred to as joints, and **MUST** be named using a `J` followed by a monotonically increasing number; for example, `J1`, `J2`, `J3`.  The numbering starts at the base axis connected or closest to the mounting surface, `J1`, incrementing to the mechanical interface, `Jn`, where `n` is the number of the last axis. The chain forms a parent-child relationship with the parent being the axis closest to the base.

A machine having an axis with more than one child **MUST** number each branch using its numeric designation followed by a branch number and a monotonically increasing number. For example, if `J2` has two children, the first child branch **MUST** be named `J2.1.1` and the second child branch `J2.2.1`. A child of the first branch **MUST** be named `J2.1.2`, incrementing to `J2.1.n`, where `J2.1.n` is the number of the last axis in that branch.


#### Linear

{{block(Component Types::Axis)}} that provides prismatic motion along a fixed axis.



#### Rotary

{{block(Component Types::Axis)}} that provides rotation about a fixed axis.



#### `<<deprecated>>`Spindle

{{block(Spindle)}} was **DEPRECATED** in *MTConnect Version 1.1* and was replaced by {{block(RotaryMode)}}.

# Compositions Model

{{block(Composition)}} entities are used to describe the lowest level physical building blocks of a piece of equipment contained within a {{block(Component)}}. By referencing a specific {{block(Composition)}} entity, further clarification and meaning to data associated with a specific {{block(Component)}} can be achieved.

Both {{block(Component)}} and {{block(Composition)}} entities are {{term(lower level)}} entities representing the sub-parts of the parent {{block(Component)}}.  However, there are distinct differences between {{block(Component)}} and {{block(Composition)}} type entities.

{{block(Component)}} entities may be further defined with {{term(lower level)}} {{block(Component)}} entities and may have associated {{termplural(DataItem)}}.

{{block(Composition)}} entities represent the lowest level physical part of a piece of equipment.  They **MUST NOT** be further defined with {{term(lower level)}} {{block(Component)}} entities and they **MUST NOT** have {{termplural(DataItem)}} directly associated with them.   They do provide additional information that can be used to enhance the specificity of {{termplural(DataItem)}} associated with the parent {{block(Component)}}.


## Compositions

This section provides semantic information for the {{block(Composition)}} entity.

See {{figure(Components)}} for the {{block(Composition)}} model diagram.

# DataItems Model

For an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity, {{termplural(DataItem)}} describe data that can be reported by a piece of equipment and are associated with {{block(Device)}} and {{block(Component)}} entities. While the {{termplural(DataItem)}} describe the data that can be reported by a piece of equipment as an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity, the actual data values are provided by the {{block(MTConnectStreams)}} entity in the {{term(MTConnectStreams Response Document)}}.

## DataItem Types

This section provides semantic information for the types of a {{block(DataItem)}}.

In the MTConnect Standard, {{block(DataItem)}} elements are defined and organized based upon the {{property(category)}} and {{property(type)}} attributes.  The {{property(category)}} attribute provides a high level grouping for {{block(DataItem)}} elements based on the kind of information that is reported by the data item.

These categories are:

* `SAMPLE`: A `SAMPLE` reports a continuously variable or analog data value. 

* `EVENT`: An `EVENT` reports information representing a functional state, with two or more discrete values, associated with a component or it contains a message.  The data provided may be a numeric value or text.

* `CONDITION`: A `CONDITION` reports information about the health of a piece of equipment and its ability to function.

The {{property(type)}} attribute specifies the specific kind of data that is reported.   For some types of data items, a {{property(subType)}} attribute may also be used to differentiate between multiple data items of the same {{property(type)}} where the information reported by the data item has a different, but related, meaning.

Many types of data items provide two forms of data: a value (reported as either a `SAMPLE` or `EVENT`) and a health status (reported as a `CONDITION`).  These {{block(DataItem)}} types **MAY** be defined in more than one {{property(category)}} based on the data that they report.


### Condition

abstract {{block(DataItem)}} that is about an entity's status regarding its ability to operate or it provides an indication whether the data reported for the entity is within an expected range.


{{block(Condition)}} is reported differently than {{block(Sample)}} or {{block(Event)}}.  {{block(Condition)}} **MUST** be reported as {{block(Normal)}}, {{block(Warning)}}, or {{block(Fault)}}.

All {{block(Sample)}}s **MAY** have associated {{block(Condition)}} states.  {{block(Condition)}} states indicate whether the value for the data is within an expected range and **MUST** be reported as {{block(Normal)}}, or the value is unexpected or out of tolerance for the data and a {{block(Warning)}} or {{block(Fault)}} **MUST** be provided.


#### Value Properties of Condition

{{tbl(value-properties-of-condition)}} lists the Value Properties of {{block(Condition)}}.

The {{term(sensing element)}} may be modeled as a {{block(Composition)}} element of a {{block(Sensor)}} element and the measured value would be modeled as a {{block(DataItem)}} (See {{sect(DataItems)}} for more information on {{block(DataItem)}} elements).  Each {{term(sensor unit)}} may have multiple {{termplural(sensing element)}}; each representing the data for a variety of measured values.

> Note: See {{lst(example-of-sensing-element-provided-as-data-item-associated-with-a-component)}} for an {{term(XML)}} example.

When a {{term(sensor unit)}} is modeled as a {{block(Component)}} or as a separate piece of equipment, it may provide additional configuration information for the {{termplural(sensor element)}} and the {{term(sensor unit)}} itself.

See {{lst(example-of-sensor-unit-with-sensing-element)}} for an {{term(XML)}} example.

{{block(Configuration)}} data provides information required for maintenance and support of the sensor.

When {{block(Sensor)}} represents the {{term(sensor unit)}} for multiple {{term(sensing element)}}(s), each sensing element is represented by a {{block(Channel)}}.   The {{term(sensor unit)}} itself and each {{block(Channel)}} representing one {{term(sensing element)}} **MAY** have its own configuration data.

### Component with Compositions Example

In {{term(XML)}}, `Composition` types are represented differently than `Component` types. For `Component` types, the element name is Pascal Case of the `Component` type name. Whereas, the element name for all `Composition`types is `Composition` and the type is defined by the `type` attribute of the element (see example below).
