The piece of equipment that is controlling the chuck **MUST** provide the data item {{block(ChuckState)}} as part of the set of information provided.



### DoorInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between two pieces of equipment, one of which controls the operation of a door.

The piece of equipment that is controlling the door **MUST** provide data item {{block(DoorState)}} as part of the set of information provided.



### MaterialHandlerInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between a piece of equipment and another associated piece of equipment used to automatically handle various types of materials or services associated with the original piece of equipment.

A material handler is a piece of equipment capable of providing any one, or more, of a variety of support services for another piece of equipment or a process like:

* Loading/unloading material or tooling
