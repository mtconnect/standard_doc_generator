## DataItem Types for Interface

Each {{block(Interface)}} contains data items which are used to communicate information required to execute the {{term(interface)}}. When these data items are read by another piece of equipment, that piece of equipment can then determine the actions that it may take based upon that data.

{{block(InterfaceState)}} is a data item specifically defined for {{termplural(interface)}}.  It defines the operational state of the {{term(interface)}}.  This is an indicator identifying whether the {{term(interface)}} is functioning or not. See {{sect(InterfaceState)}} for complete semantic details.

Some data items **MAY** be directly associated with the {{block(Interface)}} element and others will be organized by a {{block(References)}} element. It is up to an implementer to determine which additional data items are required for a particular {{term(interface)}}.

## Specific Data Items for the Interaction Model for Interface

A special set of data items have been defined to be used in conjunction with {{block(Interface)}}. They provide information from a piece of equipment to {{term(request)}} a service to be performed by another associated piece of equipment; and for the associated piece of equipment to indicate its progress in performing its {{term(response)}} to the {{term(request)}} for service.  .

Many of the data items describing the services associated with an {{term(interface)}} are paired to describe two distinct actions â€“ one to {{term(request)}} an action to be performed and a second to reverse the action or to return to an original state.  For example, a {{block(DoorInterface)}} will have two actions {{block(OpenDoor)}} and {{block(CloseDoor)}}. An example of an implementation of this would be a robot that indicates to a machine that it would like to have a door opened so that the robot could extract a part from the machine and then asks the machine to close that door once the part has been removed. 

When these data items are used to describe a service associated with an {{term(interface)}}, they **MUST** have one of the following two `subType` elements: `REQUEST` or `RESPONSE`.  These **MUST** be specified to define whether the piece of equipment is functioning as the {{term(requester)}} or {{term(responder)}} for the service to be performed.  The {{term(requester)}} **MUST** specify the `REQUEST` `subType` for the data item and the {{term(responder)}} **MUST** specify a corresponding `RESPONSE` `subType` for the data item to enable the coordination between the two pieces of equipment.   

These data items and their associated `subType` provide the basic structure for implementing the {{term(interaction model)}} for an {{term(interface)}} and are defined in the following sections.

{{fig(Request State Machine)}} and {{fig(Response State Machine)}} show possible state transitions for a {{term(request)}} and {{term(response)}} respectively. The state machine diagrams provide the permissible values of the {{termplural(observation)}} for the {{block(DataItem)}} types listed in this section.
