# Purpose of This Document

This document, {{package(Interface Interaction Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard, defines a structured data model used to organize information required to coordinate inter-operations between pieces of equipment.  

This data model is based on an {{term(interaction model)}} that defines the exchange of information between pieces of equipment and is organized in the MTConnect Standard by {{block(Interfaces)}}.   

{{block(Interfaces)}} is modeled as an extension to the {{term(Device Information Model)}} and {{term(Observation Information Model)}}.  {{block(Interfaces)}} leverages similar rules and terminology as those used to describe a component in the {{term(Device Information Model)}}.  {{block(Interfaces)}} also uses similar methods for reporting data to those used in the {{term(MTConnectStreams Response Document)}}.  

As defined in {{package(Device Information Model)}}, {{block(Interfaces)}} {{termplural(organize)}} the {{block(Interface)}} types (see {{figure(Interfaces in Entity Hierarchy)}}).  Each individual {{block(Interface)}} contains data associated with the corresponding {{term(interface)}}.

> Note: See {{package(Device Information Model)}} and {{package(Observation Information Model)}} of the MTConnect Standard for information on how {{block(Interfaces)}} is structured in the {{termplural(response document)}} which are returned from an {{term(agent)}} in response to a {{term(probe request)}}, {{term(sample request)}}, or {{term(current request)}}.

# Interface Interaction Model

In many manufacturing processes, multiple pieces of equipment must work together to perform a task.  The traditional method for coordinating the activities between individual pieces of equipment is to connect them using a series of wires to communicate equipment states and demands for action.  These interactions use simple binary ON/OFF signals to accomplished their intention.

In the MTConnect Standard, {{termplural(interface)}} provides a means to replace this traditional method for interconnecting pieces of equipment with a structured {{term(interaction model)}} that provides a rich set of information used to coordinate the actions between pieces of equipment.  Implementers may utilize the information provided by this data model to (1) realize the interaction between pieces of equipment and (2) to extend the functionality of the equipment to improve the overall performance of the manufacturing process. 

The {{term(interaction model)}} used to implement {{termplural(interface)}} provides a lightweight and efficient protocol, simplifies failure recovery scenarios, and defines a structure for implementing a Plug-And-Play relationship between pieces of equipment.  By standardizing the information exchange using this higher-level semantic information model, an implementer may more readily replace a piece of equipment in a manufacturing system with any other piece of equipment capable of providing similar {{term(interaction model)}} functions.

Two primary functions are required to implement the {{term(interaction model)}} for an {{termplural(interface)}} and manage the flow of information between pieces of equipment.  Each piece of equipment needs to have the following:

* An {{term(agent)}} which provides:
    
 - The data required to implement the {{term(interaction model)}}.
    
 - Any other data from a piece of equipment needed to implement the {{term(interface)}} â€“ operating states of the equipment, position information, execution modes, process information, etc. 
 
* A client software application that enables the piece of equipment to acquire and interpret information from another piece of equipment. 


## Interfaces Architecture

MTConnect Standard is based on a communications method that provides no direct way for one piece of equipment to change the state of or cause an action to occur in another piece of equipment.  The {{term(interaction model)}} used to implement {{termplural(interface)}} is based on a {{term(publish and subscribe)}} type of communications as described in {{package(Fundamentals)}} and utilizes a {{term(request)}} and {{term(response)}} information exchange mechanism.  For {{termplural(interface)}}, pieces of equipment must perform both the publish ({{term(agent)}}) and subscribe (client) functions.  


> Note: The current definition of {{termplural(interface)}} addresses the interaction between two pieces of equipment.  Future releases of the MTConnect Standard may address the interaction between multiple (more than two) pieces of equipment.

![Data Flow Architecture for Interfaces](figures/Data%20Flow%20Architecture%20for%20Interfaces.png "Data Flow Architecture for Interfaces"){: width="0.8"}

> Note: The data flow architecture illustrated in {{figure(Data Flow Architecture for Interfaces)}} was historically referred to in the MTConnect Standard as a read-read concept.

In the implementation of the {{term(interaction model)}} for {{termplural(interface)}}, two pieces of equipment can exchange information in the following manner.  One piece of equipment indicates a {{term(request)}} for service by publishing a type of {{term(request)}} using a data item provided through an {{term(agent)}} as defined in {{package(DataItem Types for Interface)}}.  The client associated with the second piece of equipment, which is subscribing to data from the first machine, detects and interprets that {{term(request)}}.  If the second machine chooses to take any action to fulfill this {{term(request)}}, it can indicate its acceptance by publishing a {{term(response)}} using a data item provided through its {{term(agent)}}.  The client on the first piece of equipment continues to monitor information from the second piece of equipment until it detects an indication that the {{term(response)}} to the {{term(request)}} has been completed or has failed.

An example of this type of interaction between pieces of equipment can be represented by a machine tool that wants the material to be loaded by a robot.  In this example, the machine tool is the {{term(requester)}}, and the robot is the {{term(responder)}}.  On the other hand, if the robot wants the machine tool to open a door, the robot becomes the {{term(requester)}} and the machine tool the {{term(responder)}}.

## Request and Response Information Exchange

The {{block(DataItem)}} elements defined by the {{term(interaction model)}} each have a `REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` subtype.  These subtypes identify if the data item represents a {{term(request)}} or a {{term(response)}}.  Using these data items, a piece of equipment changes the state of its {{term(request)}} or {{term(response)}} to indicate information that can be read by the other piece of equipment.  To aid in understanding how the {{term(interaction model)}} functions, one can view this {{term(interaction model)}} as a simple state machine. 

The interaction between two pieces of equipment can be described as follows.  When the {{term(requester)}} wants an activity to be performed, it transitions its {{term(request)}} state from a `READY` state to an `ACTIVE` state.  In turn, when the client on the {{term(responder)}} reads this information and interprets the {{term(request)}}, the {{term(responder)}} announces that it is performing the requested task by changing its response state to `ACTIVE`.  When the action is finished, the {{term(responder)}} changes its response state to `COMPLETE`.  This pattern of {{term(request)}} and {{term(response)}} provides the basis for the coordination of actions between pieces of equipment.  These actions are implemented using `EVENT` category data items.  (See {{package(DataItem Types for Interface)}} for details on the {{block(Event)}} type data items defined for {{termplural(interface)}}.)

> Note: The implementation details of how the {{term(responder)}} piece of equipment reacts to the {{term(request)}} and then completes the requested task are up to the implementer.

![Request and Response Overview](figures/Request%20and%20Response%20Overview.png "Request and Response Overview"){: width="0.8"}

The initial condition of both the {{term(request)}} and {{term(response)}} states on both pieces of equipment is `READY`.  The dotted lines indicate the on-going communications that occur to monitor the progress of the interactions between the pieces of equipment.

The interaction between the pieces of equipment as illustrated in {{figure(Request and Response Overview)}} progresses through the sequence listed below.

* The {{term(request)}} transitions from `READY` to `ACTIVE` signaling that a service is needed.

* The {{term(response)}} detects the transition of the {{term(request)}}.

* The {{term(response)}} transitions from `READY` to `ACTIVE` indicating that it is performing the action.

* Once the action has been performed, the {{term(response)}} transitions to `COMPLETE`.

* The {{term(request)}} detects the action is `COMPLETE`.

* The {{term(request)}} transitions back to `READY` acknowledging that the service has been performed.

* The {{term(response)}} detects the {{term(request)}} has returned to `READY`.

* In recognition of this acknowledgement, the {{term(response)}} transitions back to `READY`.

After the final action has been completed, both pieces of equipment are back in the `READY` state indicating that they are able to perform another action.

# Interfaces for Device and Observation Information Models

The {{term(interaction model)}} for implementing {{termplural(interface)}} is defined in the MTConnect Standard as an extension to the {{term(Device Information Model)}} and {{term(Observation Information Model)}}.

A piece of equipment **MAY** support multiple different {{termplural(interface)}}. Each piece of equipment supporting {{termplural(interface)}} **MUST** model the information associated with each {{term(interface)}} as an {{block(Interface)}} component.  {{block(Interface)}} is an abstract {{block(Component)}} and is realized by {{block(Interface)}} component types. 

The {{figure(Interfaces in Entity Hierarchy)}} illustrates where an {{block(Interface)}} is modeled in the {{term(Device Information Model)}} for a piece of equipment.

![Interfaces in Entity Hierarchy](figures/Interfaces%20in%20Entity%20Hierarchy.png "Interfaces in Entity Hierarchy"){: width="0.8"}


## Interface Types

The abstract {{block(Interface)}} is realized by the following types listed in this section. 

In order to implement the {{term(interaction model)}} for {{termplural(interface)}}, each piece of equipment associated with an {{term(interface)}} **MUST** provide the corresponding {{block(Interface)}} type. A piece of equipment **MAY** support any number of unique {{termplural(interface)}}.

### BarFeederInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between a bar feeder and another piece of equipment.

Bar feeder is a piece of equipment that pushes bar stock (i.e., long pieces of material of various shapes) into an associated piece of equipment â€“ most typically a lathe or turning center.



### ChuckInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between two pieces of equipment, one of which controls the operation of a chuck.

The piece of equipment that is controlling the chuck **MUST** provide the data item {{block(ChuckState)}} as part of the set of information provided.



### DoorInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between two pieces of equipment, one of which controls the operation of a door.

The piece of equipment that is controlling the door **MUST** provide data item {{block(DoorState)}} as part of the set of information provided.



### MaterialHandlerInterface

{{block(Interface)}} that coordinates the operations between a piece of equipment and another associated piece of equipment used to automatically handle various types of materials or services associated with the original piece of equipment.

A material handler is a piece of equipment capable of providing any one, or more, of a variety of support services for another piece of equipment or a process like:

* Loading/unloading material or tooling
* Part inspection
* Testing
* Cleaning

A robot is a common example of a material handler.





## Data for Interface

Each {{term(interface)}} **MUST** provide the data associated with the specific {{term(interface)}} to implement the {{term(interaction model)}} and any additional data that may be needed by another piece of equipment to understand the operating states and conditions of the first piece of equipment as it applies to the {{term(interface)}}.

Details on data items specific to the {{term(interaction model)}} for each type of {{term(interface)}} are provided in {{package(DataItem Types for Interface)}}.

An implementer may choose any other data available from a piece of equipment to describe the operating states and other information needed to support an {{term(interface)}}.

### References for Interface

Some of the data items needed to support a specific {{term(interface)}} may already be defined elsewhere in the {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} for a piece of equipment.  However, the implementer may not be able to directly associate this data with the {{term(interface)}} since the MTConnect Standard does not permit multiple occurrences of a piece of data to be configured in an {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}}.  {{block(References)}} provides a mechanism for associating information defined elsewhere in the {{term(information model)}} for a piece of equipment with a specific {{term(interface)}}.  

{{block(References)}} {{termplural(organize)}} {{block(Reference)}} elements.

{{block(Reference)}} is a pointer to information that is associated with another entity defined elsewhere for a piece of equipment.

{{block(References)}} is an economical syntax for providing interface specific information without directly duplicating the occurrence of the data. It provides a mechanism to include all necessary information required for interaction and deterministic information flow between pieces of equipment.

For more information on the {{block(References)}} model, see {{package(Device Information Model)}}.



## DataItem Types for Interface

Each {{block(Interface)}} contains data items which are used to communicate information required to execute the {{term(interface)}}. When these data items are read by another piece of equipment, that piece of equipment can then determine the actions that it may take based upon that data.

{{block(InterfaceState)}} is a data item specifically defined for {{termplural(interface)}}.  It defines the operational state of the {{term(interface)}}.  This is an indicator identifying whether the {{term(interface)}} is functioning or not. See {{sect(InterfaceState)}} for complete semantic details.

Some data items **MAY** be directly associated with the {{block(Interface)}} element and others will be organized by a {{block(References)}} element. It is up to an implementer to determine which additional data items are required for a particular {{term(interface)}}.

### Specific Data Items for the Interaction Model for Interface

A special set of data items have been defined to be used in conjunction with {{block(Interface)}}. They provide information from a piece of equipment to {{term(request)}} a service to be performed by another associated piece of equipment; and for the associated piece of equipment to indicate its progress in performing its {{term(response)}} to the {{term(request)}} for service.  .

Many of the data items describing the services associated with an {{term(interface)}} are paired to describe two distinct actions â€“ one to {{term(request)}} an action to be performed and a second to reverse the action or to return to an original state.  For example, a {{block(DoorInterface)}} will have two actions {{block(OpenDoor)}} and {{block(CloseDoor)}}. An example of an implementation of this would be a robot that indicates to a machine that it would like to have a door opened so that the robot could extract a part from the machine and then asks the machine to close that door once the part has been removed. 

When these data items are used to describe a service associated with an {{term(interface)}}, they **MUST** have one of the following two `subType` elements: `REQUEST` or `RESPONSE`.  These **MUST** be specified to define whether the piece of equipment is functioning as the {{term(requester)}} or {{term(responder)}} for the service to be performed.  The {{term(requester)}} **MUST** specify the `REQUEST` `subType` for the data item and the {{term(responder)}} **MUST** specify a corresponding `RESPONSE` `subType` for the data item to enable the coordination between the two pieces of equipment.   

These data items and their associated `subType` provide the basic structure for implementing the {{term(interaction model)}} for an {{term(interface)}} and are defined in the following sections.

{{figure(Request State Machine)}} and {{figure(Response State Machine)}} show possible state transitions for a {{term(request)}} and {{term(response)}} respectively. The state machine diagrams provide the permissible values of the {{termplural(observation)}} for the {{block(DataItem)}} types listed in this section.

# Operation and Error Recovery

The {{term(request and response)}} state model implemented for {{termplural(interface)}} may also be represented by a graphical model.  The scenario in {{figure(Success Scenario)}} demonstrates the state transitions that occur during a successful {{term(request)}} for service and the resulting {{term(response)}} to fulfill that service {{term(request)}}. 

![Success Scenario](figures/Success%20Scenario.png "Success Scenario"){: width="0.8"}




## Request and Response Failure Handling and Recovery

A significant feature of the {{term(request and response)}} {{term(interaction model)}} is the ability for either piece of equipment to detect a failure associated with either the {{term(request)}} or {{term(response)}} actions.  When either a failure or unexpected action occurs, the {{term(request)}} and the {{term(response)}} portion of the {{term(interaction model)}} can announce a `FAIL` state upon detecting a problem.  The following are graphical models describing multiple scenarios where either the {{term(requester)}} or {{term(responder)}} detects and reacts to a failure.  In these examples, either the {{term(requester)}} or {{term(responder)}} announces the detection of a failure by setting either the {{term(request)}} or the {{term(response)}} state to `FAIL`.  

Once a failure is detected, the {{term(interaction model)}} provides information from each piece of equipment as they attempt to recover from a failure, reset all of their functions associated with the {{term(interface)}} to their original state, and return to normal operation.

The following sections are scenarios that describe how pieces of equipment may react to different types of failures and how they indicate when they are again ready to request a service or respond to a request for service after recovering from those failures:

### Responder Fails Immediately

In this scenario, a failure is detected by the {{term(responder)}} immediately after a {{term(request)}} for service has been initiated by the {{term(requester)}}.

![Responder Fails Immediately](figures/Responder%20Fails%20Immediately.png "Responder Fails Immediately"){: width="0.8"}

In this case, the {{term(request)}} transitions to `ACTIVE` and the {{term(responder)}} immediately detects a failure before it can transition the {{term(response)}} state to `ACTIVE`.  When this occurs, the {{term(responder)}} transitions the {{term(response)}} state to `FAIL`.

After detecting that the {{term(responder)}} has transitioned its state to `FAIL`, the {{term(requester)}} **MUST** change its state to `FAIL`.

The {{term(requester)}}, as part of clearing a failure, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(requester)}} changes its state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(requester)}} cannot return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

The {{term(responder)}}, as part of clearing a failure, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

### Responder Fails While Providing a Service

This is the most common failure scenario.  In this case, the {{term(responder)}} will begin the actions required to provide a service.  During these actions, the {{term(responder)}} detects a failure and transitions its {{term(response)}} state to `FAIL`.

![Responder Fails While Providing a Service](figures/Responder%20Fails%20While%20Providing%20a%20Service.png "Responder Fails While Providing a Service"){: width="0.8"}

When a {{term(requester)}} detects a failure of a {{term(responder)}}, it transitions it state from `ACTIVE` to `FAIL`.  

The {{term(requester)}} resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(requester)}} changes its state from `FAIL` to `READY` if the failure has been cleared and it is again prepared to request another service.  If for some reason the {{term(requester)}} cannot return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

The {{term(responder)}}, as part of clearing a failure, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from `FAIL` to `READY` if it is again prepared to perform a service.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

### Requester Failure During a Service Request

In this scenario, the {{term(responder)}} will begin the actions required to provide a service.  During these actions, the {{term(requester)}} detects a failure and transitions its {{term(request)}} state to `FAIL`.

![Requester Fails During a Service Request](figures/Requester%20Fails%20During%20a%20Service%20Request.png "Requester Fails During a Service Request"){: width="0.8"}

When the {{term(responder)}} detects that the {{term(requester)}} has transitioned its {{term(request)}} state to `FAIL`, the {{term(responder)}} also transitions its {{term(response)}} state to `FAIL`. 

The {{term(requester)}}, as part of clearing a failure, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(requester)}} changes its state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(requester)}} cannot return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

The {{term(responder)}}, as part of clearing a failure, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

### Requester Changes to an Unexpected State While Responder is Providing a Service

In some cases, a {{term(requester)}} may transition to an unexpected state after it has initiated a {{term(request)}} for service.  

As demonstrated in {{figure(Requester Makes Unexpected State Change)}}, the {{term(requester)}} has initiated a {{term(request)}} for service and its {{term(request)}} state has been changed to `ACTIVE`.  The {{term(responder)}} begins the actions required to provide the service.  During these actions, the {{term(requester)}} transitions its {{term(request)}} state back to `READY` before the {{term(responder)}} can complete its actions.  This **SHOULD** be regarded as a failure of the {{term(requester)}}.

![Requester Makes Unexpected State Change](figures/Requester%20Makes%20Unexpected%20State%20Change.png "Requester Makes Unexpected State Change"){: width="0.8"}

In this case, the {{term(responder)}} reacts to this change of state of the {{term(requester)}} in the same way as though the {{term(requester)}} had transitioned its {{term(request)}} state to `FAIL` (i.e., the same as in Scenario 3 above).

At this point, the {{term(responder)}} then transitions its {{term(response)}} state to `FAIL`.

The {{term(responder)}} resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to its original condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

> Note: The same scenario exists if the {{term(requester)}} transitions its {{term(request)}} state to `NOT_READY`.  However, in this case, the {{term(requester)}} then transitions its {{term(request)}} state to `READY` after it resets all of its functions back to a condition where it is again prepared to make a {{term(request)}} for service.


### Responder Changes to an Unexpected State While Providing a Service

Similar to Scenario 5, a {{term(responder)}} may transition to an unexpected state while providing a service.  

As demonstrated in {{figure(Responder Makes Unexpected State Change)}}, the {{term(responder)}} is performing the actions to provide a service and the {{term(response)}} state is `ACTIVE`.  During these actions, the {{term(responder)}} transitions its state to `NOT_READY` before completing its actions.  This should be regarded as a failure of the {{term(responder)}}.

![Responder Makes Unexpected State Change](figures/Responder%20Makes%20Unexpected%20State%20Change.png "Responder Makes Unexpected State Change"){: width="0.8"}

Upon detecting an unexpected state change of the {{term(responder)}}, the {{term(requester)}} transitions its state to `FAIL`.  

The {{term(requester)}} resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(requester)}} changes its state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(requester)}} cannot return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

Since the {{term(responder)}} has failed to an invalid state, the condition of the {{term(responder)}} is unknown.  Where possible, the {{term(responder)}} should try to reset to an initial state. 

The {{term(responder)}}, as part of clearing the cause for the change to the unexpected state, should attempt to reset any partial actions that were initiated and then return to a condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from the unexpected state to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it maintains its state as `NOT_READY`. 

### Responder or Requester Become UNAVAILABLE or Experience a Loss of Communication

In this scenario, a failure occurs in the communications connection between the {{term(responder)}} and {{term(requester)}}.  This failure may result from the {{block(InterfaceState)}} from either piece of equipment returning a value of `UNAVAILABLE` or one of the pieces of equipment does not provide a heartbeat within the desired amount of time (See {{package(Fundamentals)}} for details on heartbeat).   

![Requester - Responder Communication Failure 1](figures/Requester%20-%20Responder%20Communication%20Failure%201.png "Requester - Responder Communication Failure 1"){: width="0.8"}

![Requester - Responder Communication Failure 2](figures/Requester%20-%20Responder%20Communication%20Failure%202.png "Requester - Responder Communication Failure 2"){: width="0.8"}

When one of these situations occurs, each piece of equipment assumes that there has been a failure of the other piece of equipment.

When normal communications are re-established, neither piece of equipment should assume that the {{term(request and response)}} state of the other piece of equipment remains valid.  Both pieces of equipment should set their state to `FAIL`.

The {{term(requester)}}, as part of clearing its `FAIL` state, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(requester)}} changes its state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(requester)}} cannot return to a condition where it is again ready to request a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.

The {{term(responder)}}, as part of clearing its `FAIL` state, resets any partial actions that were initiated and attempts to return to a condition where it is again ready to perform a service.  If the recovery is successful, the {{term(responder)}} changes its {{term(response)}} state from `FAIL` to `READY`.  If for some reason the {{term(responder)}} is not again prepared to perform a service, it transitions its state from `FAIL` to `NOT_READY`.
