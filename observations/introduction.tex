\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart3} of the MTConnect  Standard, establishes the rules and terminology that describes the information returned by an \gls{MTConnect Agent} from a piece of equipment.  The {{term(Observations Information Model}} also defines, in \sect{Observations Information Model}, the structure for the \glspl{Response Document} that are returned from an \gls{Agent} in response to a \gls{Sample Request} or \gls{Current Request}.  

\citetitle{MTCPart3} is not a stand-alone document.   This document is used in conjunction with \citetitle{MTCPart1}  which defines the fundamentals of the operation of the MTConnect Standard and \citetitle{MTCPart2} that defines the semantic model representing the information that may be returned from a piece of equipment.

\begin{note}
Note: \citetitle{MTCPart5} provides details on extensions to the \gls{Observations Information Model} required to describe the interactions between pieces of equipment.
\end{note}
