\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart3} of the MTConnect  Standard, establishes the rules and terminology that describes the information returned by an MTConnect \gls{Agent} from a piece of equipment.  The \gls{streams information model} also defines, in \sect{Streams Information Model}, the structure for the XML documents that are returned from an \gls{Agent} in response to a \gls{Sample Request} or \gls{Current Request}.  

\citetitle{MTCPart3} is not a stand-alone document.   This document is used in conjunction with \citetitle{MTCPart1}  which defines the fundamentals of the operation of the MTConnect Standard and \citetitle{MTCPart2} that defines the semantic model representing the information that may be returned from a piece of equipment.

\begin{note}
Note: \citetitle{MTCPart5} provides details on extensions to the \gls{streams information model} required to describe the interactions between pieces of equipment.
\end{note}

In the MTConnect Standard, equipment represents any tangible property that is used in the operation of a manufacturing facility.  Examples of equipment are machine tools, ovens, sensor units, workstations, software applications, and bar feeders.

\section{Terminology and Conventions}
Refer to \textit{Section 3} of \citetitle{MTCPart1} for a dictionary of terms, reserved language, and document conventions used in the MTConnect Standard.
