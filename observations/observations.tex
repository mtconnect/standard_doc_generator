\section{Observations Information Model}
\label{sec:Observations Information Model}
The \gls{streams information model} provides a representation of the data reported by a piece of equipment used for a manufacturing process, or used for any other purpose.  Additional descriptive information associated with the reported data is defined in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document, which is described in \citetitle{MTCPart2}.

Information defined in the \gls{streams information model} allows a software application to (1) determine the value for \glspl{data entity} returned from a piece of equipment and (2) interpret the data associated with those \glspl{data entity} with the same meaning, value, and context that it had at its original source.  To do this, the software application issues one of two HTTP requests to an \gls{agent} associated with a piece of equipment.  They are:


\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{sample httprequest}:  Returns a designated number of time stamped \glspl{data entity} from an \gls{agent} associated with a piece of equipment; subject to any HTTP filtering associated with the request.  See \textit{Section 8.3.3} of \citetitle{MTCPart1} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the \gls{sample httprequest} HTTP request.

\item \gls{current httprequest}:  Returns a snapshot of either the most recent values or the values at a given sequence number for all \glspl{data entity} associated with a piece of equipment from an \gls{agent}; subject to any HTTP filtering associated with the request.  See \textit{Section 8.3.2} of \citetitle{MTCPart1} of the MTConnect Standard for details on the \gls{current httprequest} HTTP request.
\end{itemize}

An \gls{agent} responds to either the \gls{sample httprequest} or \gls{current httprequest} HTTP request with an \linebreak\gls{mtconnectstreams} \gls{xml} document.  This document contains information describing \glspl{data entity} reported by an \gls{agent} associated with a piece of equipment.   A client software application may correlate the information provided in the \gls{mtconnectstreams} \gls{xml} document with the physical and logical structure for that piece of equipment defined in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document to form a clear and unambiguous understanding of the information provided.  (See details on the structure for a piece of equipment described in \citetitle{MTCPart2}).

The \gls{mtconnectstreams} \gls{xml} document is comprised of two sections: \gls{header} and \gls{streams}.

The \gls{header} section contains protocol related information as defined in \textit{Section 6.5} of \citetitle{MTCPart1} of the MTConnect Standard.

The \gls{streams} section of the \gls{mtconnectstreams} document contains a \linebreak\gls{devicestream} \gls{xml} container for each piece of equipment represented in the document.  Each \gls{devicestream} container is comprised of two primary types of \gls{xml} elements â€“ \glspl{structural element} and \glspl{data entity}.  The contents of the \gls{devicestream} container are described in detail in this document, \citetitle{MTCPart3} of the MTConnect Standard.

\glspl{structural element} are defined for both the \gls{mtconnectdevices} and the \gls{mtconnectstreams} \gls{xml} documents.  These \glspl{structural element} are used to provide a logical organization of the information provided in each document.  While used for a similar purpose, the \glspl{structural element} in the \gls{mtconnectstreams} document are specifically designed to be distinctly different from those in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document:  

\begin{itemize}

\item \gls{mtconnectdevices} document: \glspl{structural element} organize information that represents the physical and logical parts and sub-parts of a piece of equipment.  (See \citetitle{MTCPart2}, Section 4 of the MTConnect Standard for more details on \glspl{structural element} used in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document).  

\item \gls{mtconnectstreams} document: \glspl{structural element} provide the structure to organize the data returned from a piece of equipment and establishes the proper context for that data.  The \glspl{structural element} specifically defined for use in the \gls{mtconnectstreams} document are \gls{devicestream} (see \sect{DeviceStream}) and \gls{componentstream} (see \sect{ComponentStream}).   

\gls{devicestream} and \gls{componentstream} elements have a direct correlation to each of the \glspl{structural element} defined in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document.
\end{itemize}

\glspl{data entity} that describe data reported by a piece of equipment are also defined for both the \gls{mtconnectdevices} and the \gls{mtconnectstreams} \gls{xml} documents.  The \glspl{data entity} provided in both documents directly relate to each other.  However, \glspl{data entity} are used for different purposes in each document:

\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{mtconnectdevices} document: \gls{data entity} elements define the data that may be returned from a piece of equipment.  \citetitle{MTCPart2}, \textit{Sections 7 and 8} lists the possible \gls{data entity} \gls{xml} elements that can be returned in a \gls{mtconnectdevices} document.  

\item \gls{mtconnectstreams} document: \gls{data entity} elements provide the data reported by a piece of equipment.  This data is organized in separate \gls{componentstream} \gls{xml} containers for each of the \glspl{structural element} defined in the \gls{mtconnectdevices} document associated with the data that is reported by a piece of equipment.  
\end{itemize}

Within each \gls{componentstream} \gls{xml} container in the \gls{mtconnectstreams} document, \glspl{data entity} are organized into three types of \gls{xml} container elements - \glspl{sample}, \glspl{event}, and \glspl{condition}.  (See \sect{Data Entities} and \sect{Listing of Data Entities} for more information on these elements.)

\gls{observation} elements are represented by \gls{sample}, \gls{event} or \gls{condition} elements based upon the \gls{category} and \gls{type} attributes defined for the corresponding \gls{dataitem}.
