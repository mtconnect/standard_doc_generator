ACTUATOR,"A mechanism for moving or controlling a mechanical part of a piece of equipment.   
 It takes energy usually provided by air, electric current, or liquid and converts the energy into some kind of motion. "
AMPLIFIER,"An electronic component or circuit for amplifying power, electric current, or voltage."
BALLSCREW,A mechanical structure for transforming rotary motion into linear motion.
BELT,An endless flexible band used to transmit motion for a piece of equipment or to convey materials and objects.
BRAKE,"A mechanism for slowing or stopping a moving object by the absorption or transfer of the energy of momentum, usually by means of friction, electrical force, or magnetic force."
CHAIN,An interconnected series of objects that band together and are used to transmit motion for a piece of equipment or to convey materials and objects.
CHOPPER,A mechanism used to break material into smaller pieces.
CHUCK,"A mechanism that holds a part, stock material, or any other item in place."
CHUTE,An inclined channel for conveying material.
CIRCUIT_BREAKER,A mechanism for interrupting an electric circuit.
CLAMP,"A mechanism used to strengthen, support, or fasten objects in place."
COMPRESSOR,A pump or other mechanism for reducing volume and increasing pressure of gases in order to condense the gases to drive pneumatically powered pieces of equipment.
DOOR,A mechanical mechanism or closure that can cover a physical access portal into a piece of equipment allowing or restricting access to other parts of the equipment.
DRAIN,"A mechanism that allows material to flow for the purpose of drainage from, for example, a vessel or tank."
