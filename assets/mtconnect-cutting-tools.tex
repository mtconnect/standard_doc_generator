\section{CuttingTool Information model}
The \gls{cuttingtool} \gls{information model} illustrated in \fig{cuttingtool-schema} has the identical structure as the \gls{cuttingtoolarchetype} \gls{information model} except for the XML element \gls{cuttingtooldefinition} that has been \DEPRECATED in the \gls{cuttingtool} schema.

\subsection{Attributes for CuttingTool}
Refer to \sect{Common Attributes for CuttingTool and CuttingToolArchetype} for a full description of the \glspl{attribute} for \gls{cuttingtool} \gls{information model}.

\subsection{Elements for CuttingTool}
The elements associated with \gls{cuttingtool} are given below.    The elements \MUST be provided in the order shown in \tbl{elements-for-cuttingtool} as prescribed by XML.

\subsubsection{CuttingToolLifeCycle Elements for CuttingTool Only}

The following \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} elements are used only in the \gls{cuttingtool} \gls{information model} and are not part of the \gls{cuttingtoolarchetype} \gls{information model}. Refer to \sect{Common Entity CuttingToolLifeCycle} for a complete description of the remaining elements for \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} that are common in both \glspl{information model}.  Refer also to the \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} schema illustrated in \fig{cuttingtoollifecycle-schema}.

\FloatBarrier

The elements of the \gls{cutterstatus} element can be a combined set of \gls{status cutterstatus} elements.  The \gls{mtconnect standard} allows any set of statuses to be combined, but only certain combinations make sense.  A \gls{cuttingtool} \SHOULD not be both \gls{new status} and \gls{used status} at the same time.  There are no rules in the schema to enforce this, but this is left to the implementer.  The following combinations \MUSTNOT occur: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{new status} \MUSTNOT be used with \gls{used status}, \gls{reconditioned status}, or \gls{expired status}.
    \item \gls{unknown status} \MUSTNOT be used with any other status. 
    \item \gls{allocated status} and \gls{unallocated status} \MUSTNOT be used together.
    \item \gls{available value} and \gls{unavailable value} \MUSTNOT be used together.
    \item If the tool is \gls{expired status}, \gls{broken status}, or \gls{notregistered status} it \MUSTNOT be \gls{available value}.
    \item All other combinations are allowed.
\end{itemize}

The value is the current value for the \gls{toollife}.  The value \MUST be a number.  \gls{toollife} is an option element which can have three types, either minutes for time based, part count for parts based, or wear based using a distance measure.  One \gls{toollife} element can appear for each type, but there cannot be two entries of the same type.  Additional types can be added in the future.

\pagebreak

\subparagraph{Attributes for ToolLife}\mbox{}

\gls{toollife} has the following attributes that can be used to indicate the behavior of the tool life management mechanism.

\FloatBarrier

\gls{location} element identifies the specific location where a tool resides in a piece of equipment tool storage or in a tool crib.  This can be any series of numbers and letters as defined by the \gls{xml} type \gls{nmtoken}.  When a \gls{pot type} or \gls{station type} type is used, the value \MUST be a numeric value.  If a \gls{negativeoverlap} or the \gls{positiveoverlap} is provided, the tool reserves additional locations on either side, otherwise if they are not given, no additional locations are required for this tool.  If the pot occupies the first or last location, a rollover to the beginning or the end of the index-able values may occur.  For example, if there are 64 pots and the tool is in pot 64 with a \gls{positiveoverlap} of 1, the first pot \MAY be occupied as well.

\subparagraph{Attributes for Location}\mbox{}

\section{Common Entity CuttingToolLifeCycle}
\label{sec:Common Entity CuttingToolLifeCycle}

\subsection{CuttingToolLifeCycle}
\label{sec:CuttingToolLifeCycle}

The life cycle refers to the data pertaining to the application or the use of the tool.  This data is provided by various pieces of equipment (i.e. machine tool, presetter) and statistical process control applications.  Life cycle data will not remain static, but will change periodically when a tool is used or measured.  The life cycle has three conceptual parts; \gls{cuttingtool} and \gls{cuttingitem} identity, properties, and measurements.  A measurement is defined as a constrained value that is reported in defined units and as a W3C floating point format.

The \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} contains data for the entire tool assembly.  The specific \glspl{cuttingitem} that are part of the \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} are contained in the \glspl{cuttingitem} element.  Each Cutting Item has similar properties as the assembly; identity, properties, and \glspl{measurement}.

The units for all \glspl{measurement} have been predefined in the \gls{mtconnect standard} and will be consistent with \citetitle{MTCPart2} and \citetitle{MTCPart3}.  This means that all lengths and distances will be given in millimeters and all angular measures will be given in degrees.  Quantities like \gls{processspindlespeed} will be given in RPM, the same as the \gls{rotaryvelocity sample} in \citetitle{MTCPart3}.

\subsubsection{XML Schema Structure for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

The \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} schema shown in \fig{cuttingtoollifecycle-schema} is used in both the \gls{cuttingtoolarchetype} and \gls{cuttingtool} \glspl{information model}.  The only difference is that the elements \gls{cutterstatus}, \gls{toollife}, \gls{location}, and \gls{reconditioncount} are used only in the \gls{cuttingtool} \gls{information model}.

\subsubsection{ProgramToolGroup Element for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

The optional identifier for the group of Cutting Tools when multiple tools can be used interchangeably. This is defined as an XML string type and is implementation dependent. 

\subsubsection{ProgramToolNumber Element for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

\subsubsection{ConnectionCodeMachineSide Element for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

This is an optional identifier for implementation specific connection component of the Cutting Tool on the machine side.  Code: \cfont{CCMS}.  The \gls{cdata} \MAY be any valid string according to the referenced connection code standards.

\subsubsection{xs:any Element for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

Utilizing the new capability in \gls{xml schema} Version 1.1, there are extension points where an additional element can be added to the document without being part of a substitution group.  The new elements have the restriction that they \MUSTNOT be part of the \gls{mtconnect} \gls{namespace} and \MUSTNOT be one of the predefined elements mentioned above.

This allows one to add additional properties to the \gls{cuttingtool} without having to change the definition of the \gls{cuttingtool} or modify the standard. The new capabilities were introduced in Version 1.3 of the \gls{mtconnect standard} and necessitate using Version 1.1 of \gls{xml schema} to make use of this form of extensible properties. 

\subsubsection{Measurements Element for CuttingToolLifeCycle}

The \glspl{measurement} element is a collection of one or more constrained scalar values associated with this Cutting Tool.  The \gls{xml} element \MUST be a type extension of the base types \gls{commonmeasurement} or \gls{assemblymeasurement}.  The following section defines the abstract \gls{measurement} type used in both \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} and \gls{cuttingitem}.  This subsequent sections describe the \gls{assemblymeasurement} types followed by the \gls{cuttingitemmeasurement} types.

A \gls{measurement} is specific to the tool management policy at a particular shop.  The tool zero reference point or gauge line will be different depending on the particular implementation and will be assumed to be consistent within the shop.  \gls{mtconnect standard} does not standardize the manufacturing process or the definition of the zero point.

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

A \gls{measurement} \MUST be a scalar floating-point value that \MAY be constrained to a maximum and minimum value.  Since the \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle}’s main responsibility is to track aspects of the tool that change over its use in the shop, \gls{mtconnect} represents the current value of the \gls{measurement} \MUST be in the \gls{cdata} (text between the start and end element) as the most current valid value.

The \gls{minimum attribute} and \gls{maximum attribute} \MAY be supplied if they are known or relevant to the \gls{measurement}.  A \gls{nominal attribute} value \MAY be provided to show the reference value for this \gls{measurement}.

There are three abstract subtypes of  \gls{measurement}: \gls{commonmeasurement}, \gls{assemblymeasurement}, and \gls{cuttingitemmeasurement}.  These abstract types \MUSTNOT appear in an \gls{mtconnectassets} document, but are used in the schema as a way to separate which measurements \MAY appear in the different sections of the document.  Only subtypes that have extended these types \MAY appear in the \gls{mtconnectassets} XML.

\Glspl{measurement} in the \gls{cuttingtoollifecycle} section \MUST refer to the entire assembly and not to an individual \gls{cuttingitem}. \gls{cuttingitem} measurements \MUST be located in the measurements associated with the individual \gls{cuttingitem}.

\Glspl{measurement}  \MAY provide an optional \gls{units} attribute to reinforce the given units.  The units \MUST always be given in the predefined MTConnect units.  If \gls{units} are provided, they are only for documentation purposes.  \gls{nativeunits} \MAY optionally be provided to indicate the original units provided for the measurements.

\paragraph{Attributes for CuttingItems}\mbox{}

\input{tables/attributes-for-cuttingitems.tex}


\subsubsection{CuttingItem}

A \gls{cuttingitem} is the portion of the tool that physically removes the material from the workpiece by shear deformation.  The Cutting Item can be either a single piece of material attached to the \gls{cuttingitem} or it can be one or more separate pieces of material attached to the \gls{cuttingitem} using a permanent or removable attachment.  A \gls{cuttingitem} can be comprised of one or more cutting edges.  \glspl{cuttingitem} include: replaceable inserts, brazed tips and the cutting portions of solid \glspl{cuttingtool}.

MTConnect Standard considers \glspl{cuttingitem} as part of the \gls{cuttingtool}.  A \glspl{cuttingitem} \MUSTNOT exist in MTConnect unless it is attached to a \gls{cuttingtool}.  Some of the measurements, such as \gls{functionallength}, \MUST be made with reference to the entire \gls{cuttingtool} to be meaningful.
