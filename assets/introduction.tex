\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart41} of the MTConnect Standard, establishes the rules and terminology to be used by designers to describe the function and operation of cutting tools used within manufacturing and to define the data that is provided by an \gls{agent} from a piece of equipment.  This part of the Standard also defines the structure for the XML document that is returned from an \gls{agent} in response to a \gls{probe httprequest} request. 

The data associated with these cutting tools will be retrieved from multiple sources that are responsible for providing their knowledge of an \gls{mtconnect asset}.

\section{Terminology and Conventions}
Refer to Section 2 of \citetitle{MTCPart1} for a dictionary of terms, reserved language, and document conventions used in the MTConnect Standard.
