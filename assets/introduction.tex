\section{Purpose of This Document}

This document, \citetitle{MTCPart40} of the MTConnect Standard, details information that is common to all types of \glspl{MTConnect Asset}.  Part 4.0 and its sub-parts of the MTConnect Standard provide semantic models for entities that are used in the manufacturing process, but are not considered to be a piece of equipment.  These entities are defined as \glspl{MTConnect Asset}.  These \glspl{Asset} may be removed from a piece of equipment without detriment to the function of the equipment and can be associated with other pieces of equipment during their lifecycle.  The data associated with these \glspl{Asset} may be retrieved from multiple sources that are each responsible for providing their knowledge of the \gls{Asset}.

\section{Terminology and Conventions}
Refer to Section 3 of \citetitle{MTCPart1} for a dictionary of terms, reserved language, and document conventions used in the MTConnect Standard.
