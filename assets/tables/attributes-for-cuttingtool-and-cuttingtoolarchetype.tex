\gls{timestamp}
&
The time this \gls{mtconnect asset} was last modified. Always given in UTC. The \gls{timestamp} \MUST be provided in UTC (Universal Time Coordinate, also known as GMT). This is the time the \gls{asset} data was last modified.
\newline \gls{timestamp} is a required attribute.
&
1 \\
\hline
 
\gls{assetid}
&
The unique identifier of the instance of this tool. This will be the
same as the \gls{toolid} and \gls{serialnumber} in most cases. The \gls{assetid} \SHOULD be the combination of the \gls{toolid} and \gls{serialnumber} as in \gls{toolid}. \gls{serialnumber} or an equivalent implementation dependent identification scheme.
\newline \gls{assetid} is a required attribute.
\newline \gls{assetid} is a permanent identifier that will be associated with an \gls{mtconnect asset} for its entire life.
&
1 \\
\hline

\gls{serialnumber}
&
The unique identifier for this assembly. This is defined as an XML string type and is implementation dependent.
\newline \gls{serialnumber} is a required attribute.
&
1 \\
\hline

\gls{toolid}
&
The identifier for a class of Cutting Tools. This is defined as an XML string type and is implementation dependent.
\newline \gls{toolid} is a required attribute.
&
1 \\
\hline

\gls{deviceuuid}
&
\glsentrydesc{deviceuuid}
&
1 \\
\hline

\gls{manufacturers}
&
An optional attribute referring to the manufacturer(s) of this Cutting
Tool, for this element, this will reference the Tool Item and Adaptive
Items specifically. The Cutting Items manufacturersâ€™ will be an
attribute of the \gls{cuttingitem} elements. The representation will be a
comma (,) delimited list of manufacturer names. This can be any
series of numbers and letters as defined by the XML type \cfont{string}.

\hline

\gls{removed}
&
This is an indicator that the Cutting Tool has been removed from the piece of equipment.
\newline \gls{removed} is a required attribute.
\newline If the \gls{mtconnect asset} is marked as removed, it will not be visible to the client application unless the \cfont{includeRemoved=true} parameter is provided in the URL. If this attribute is not present it \MUST be assumed to be \cfont{false}. The value is an \cfont{xsi:boolean} type and \MUST be \cfont{true} or \cfont{false}.
